SinoatrialNode
In  humans,  the  sinoatrial  node  is  a  spindle-shaped  structure  com-
posed of a fibrous tissue matrix with closely packed cells. It is 10 to 
20 mm long and 2 to 3 mm wide and thick and tends to narrow cau-
dally toward the inferior vena cava. It lies less than 1 mm from the 
epicardial surface, laterally in the right atrial sulcus terminalis at the 
junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium (Figs. 33-1 and 
33-2).  The  artery  supplying  the  sinoatrial  node  branches  from  the 
right  (55%  to  60%  of  the  time)  or  the  left  (40%  to  45%)  circumflex 
coronary artery and approaches the node from a clockwise or coun-
terclockwise direction around the junction of the superior vena cava 
and right atrium.

Cellular Structure.  Cells from the sinoatrial node region exhibit a 
wide variety of morphologic features, including spindle- and spider-
shaped  cells,  rod-shaped  atrial  cells  with  clear  striations,  and  small 
round cells corresponding to endothelial cells.1 Only the spindle- and 
spider-shaped cells exhibit the typical electrophysiologic characteris-
tics  of  pacemaker  cells,  including  the  hyperpolarization-activated 
current If

1 and spontaneous beating under physiologic conditions.2

Function.  The  ionic  mechanism  underlying  sinoatrial  node  cell 
automaticity has been controversial. Some groups promote a model 
in  which  hyperpolarization-activated  cyclic  nucleotidegated  (HCN) 
ion channels are the main regulator of the heart rate, whereas other 
groups promote a model in which intracellular Ca2+ oscillations affect-
ing Ca2+-sensitive ion channels and ion transporters in the outer mem-
brane  give  rise  to  diastolic  membrane  depolarizations,  which  then 
trigger  a  propagating  sinoatrial  node  action  potential3,4  (see  later). 
Similarly, the mechanism of entrainment that enables synchronization 
of the electrical activity of multiple individual sinoatrial node cells to 
give rise to discharge of the sinoatrial node has been uncertain. Very 
probably, no single cell in the sinoatrial node serves as the pacemaker. 
Rather, sinoatrial nodal cells function as electrically coupled oscillators 
that discharge synchronously. The interaction depends on the degree 
of coupling and the electrophysiologic characteristics of the individual 
sinoatrial node cell. The resulting rate is not just a simple average of 
each  of  the  cells.  With  an  individual  pacemaker  cell  coupled  to  an 
average of five other cells, each with potentially different electrophysi-
ologic properties, the resulting discharge rate is not obvious. Function-
ing of the sinoatrial node as a pacemaker requires a delicate balance 
of intercellular electrical coupling. Excess electrical coupling depresses 
sinoatrial  node  automaticity  because  the  sinoatrial  node  membrane 
potential is damped by the surrounding atrial myocardium to a more 
negative potential than the normal maximal diastolic potential, thereby 
inhibiting  spontaneous  diastolic  depolarization  (see  Fig.  33-18).  Too 
little  coupling  can  prevent  transmission  of  impulses  to  the  adjacent 
atrial muscle. Restriction of the hyperpolarizing influence of the atrial 
muscle on the sinoatrial node while maintaining exit of impulses into 
the  adjacent  atrial  myocardium  is  achieved  by  the  composition  and 

spatial  organization  of  connexins,  proteins  that  form  gap  junction 
channels responsible for intercellular ion fluxes (see later, Intercalated 
Discs). Connexins 40 and 45, but not connexin 43, are expressed in 
the  central  sinoatrial  node  (Fig.  33-3).  The  major  part  of  the  crista 
terminalissinoatrial node border exhibits a sharp demarcation bound-
ary of connexin 43expressing atrial myocytes and connexin 40/45
expressing  myocytes.  On  the  endocardial  side,  a  transitional  zone 
(paranodal area; see Fig. 33-2) exists between the crista terminalis and 
the  peripheral  node  in  which  connexins  45  and  43  are  colocalized. 
This colocalization of different connexin isoforms raises the possibility 
that  individual  gap  junctional  channels  in  the  transitional  zone  are 
formed by more than one connexin isoform.2

These disparate connexin phenotypes may create specific types of 
hybrid  channels  with  rectifying  electrical  properties  that  ensure  the 
maintenance of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity but diminish elec-
trotonic interference from the atrial muscle.5 At the level of the intact 
sinoatrial node in situ, more recent studies combining immunohisto-
chemistry  and  high-resolution  optical  mapping  of  action  potentials 
have provided structural and functional evidence of the existence of 
discrete exit pathways that electrically connect the sinoatrial node and 
atria  in  canines,  whose  three-dimensional  sinoatrial  node  structure 
closely resembles that of humans. In this model (Fig. 33-4), electrical 
excitation during sinoatrial rhythm originates in the central portion of 
the  sinoatrial  node  and  spreads  bidirectionally  at  low  speed  (1  to 
14 cm/sec) within the sinoatrial node, with failure to conduct laterally 
to the crista terminalis and interatrial septum. After a conduction delay 
of  approximately  50  milliseconds  within  the  sinoatrial  node,  the 
impulse reaches the atrial myocardium via two main superior or infe-
rior  exit  pathways  located  a  few  millimeters  from  the  leading  pace-
maker site. The ellipsoidal sinoatrial node is thus functionally insulated 
from the adjacent working myocardium. This insulation coincides with 
the  lack  of  connexin  43  expression  and  the  presence  of  connective 
tissue and coronary arteries at the sinoatrial border (see Fig. 33-4C-F).6 
The  intranodal  location  of  the  primary  pacemaking  site  is  not  fixed 
but rather appears to shift under varying conditions (e.g., sympathetic 
stimulation; see later in this chapter).

A number of experimental studies have investigated the usefulness 
of gene delivery or cell-based approaches to generate biologic pace-
makers  in  the  mammalian  heart.  Gene-based  techniques  included 
transduction  of  in  situ  left  ventricular  cardiomyocytes  with  genes 
encoding a dominant-negative inwardly rectifying potassium channel 
or  isoforms  of  the  HCN  channel.  Cell-based  approaches  have  used 
human  induced  pluripotent  stem  cell  (iPSC)-derived  pacemaker-like 
cardiomyocytes  and  mesenchymal  stem  cells  ectopically  expressing 
HCN isoform 2. Clinical translatability of these approaches will require 
additional experimental testing.7

Innervation.  The sinoatrial node is densely innervated by postgan-
glionic  adrenergic  and  cholinergic  nerve  terminals.8  Discrete  vagal 
efferent  pathways  innervate  both  the  sinoatrial  and  atrioventricular 
(AV) regions of the dog and nonhuman primate. Most efferent vagal 
fibers to the atria appear to converge first at a single fat pad between 
the  medial  portion  of  the  superior  vena  cava  and  the  aortic  root, 
superior  to  the  right  pulmonary  artery;  the  fibers  then  project  onto 
two other fat pads found at the junction of the inferior vena cava and

left atrium and the junction of the right pulmonary vein and atrium 
and subsequently project to both atria. Vagal fibers to the sinoatrial 
and AV nodes also converge at the superior vena cavaaortic root fat 
pad before projection to the right pulmonary vein and inferior vena 
cava fat pads.8 Although the sinoatrial nodal region contains amounts 
of  norepinephrine  equivalent  to  those  in  other  parts  of  the  right 
atrium, acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase, and choline acetyltransfer-
ase  (the  enzyme  necessary  for  the  synthesis  of  acetylcholine)  have 
been found in greatest concentration in the sinoatrial node, with the 
next  highest  concentration  located  in  the  right  and  then  the  left 
atrium.  The  concentration  of  acetylcholine  in  the  ventricles  is  only 
20% to 50% of that in the atria.

Neurotransmitters  modulate  the  discharge  rate  of  the  sinoatrial 
node  by  stimulation  of  beta-adrenergic  and  muscarinic  receptors. 
Both  beta1  and  beta2  adrenoceptor  subtypes  are  present  in  the

(arrowheads).  (From  Anderson  RH,  Wilcox  BR,  Becker  AE:  Anatomy  of  the  normal

sinoatrial node. Human sinoatrial nodes contain more than a threefold 
greater density of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic recep-
tors  than  adjacent  atrial  tissue  does.  The  functional  significance  of 
beta adrenoceptor subtype diversity in the sinoatrial node is unclear. 
Binding of receptor agonists released from sympathetic nerve termi-
nals causes a positive chronotropic response through a beta1 receptor
activated  pathway  involving  the  stimulatory  guanosine  triphosphate 
(GTP) regulatory protein (Gs), activation of adenylyl cyclase, intracel-
lular accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), stimu-
lation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, and phosphorylation of 
ion-handling  proteins,  which  ultimately  results  in  an  increased  sino-
atrial node discharge rate (for a more detailed description of the ionic 
mechanisms  underlying  the  acceleration  of  sinoatrial  node  action 
potential firing see later in this chapter).9 The negative chronotropic 
response of vagal stimulation is mediated by acetylcholine binding to 
and ensuing activation of M2 muscarinic receptors.

In  addition  to  its  negative  chronotropic  effect,  acetylcholine  also 
prolongs intranodal conduction time, at times to the point of sinoatrial 
nodal  exit  block.  Acetylcholine  increases  whereas  norepinephrine 
decreases refractoriness in the center of the sinoatrial node. The phase 
(timing) in the cardiac cycle at which vagal discharge occurs and the 
background sympathetic tone importantly influence vagal effects on 
the  sinus  rate  and  conduction  (see  later).  After  cessation  of  vagal 
stimulation,  sinoatrial  nodal  automaticity  may  accelerate  transiently 
(postvagal tachycardia). The neurotransmitters neuropeptide Y (NPY) 
and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are localized in sympathetic and

pathways. Site 3 is from the leading pacemaker site (SAN cent), and site 4 is from the IAS block zone. Electrical excitation originates in the central portion of the SAN (dark blue 
oval in A) and spreads bidirectionally within the SAN, with failure to conduct in a perpendicular direction into the IAS and CT. After a conduction delay of approximately 50 
milliseconds within the SAN, excitation reaches the atrial myocardium via superior (upper tracings in B) or inferior (lower tracings in B) sinoatrial exit pathways approximately 
9 mm from the leading pacemaker site. The ellipsoidal SAN structure (red line in A) is functionally insulated from the atrial myocardium, as indicated by the dashed white and

If,  whereas  NPY  reversibly  decreases  If.  The  role  of  other  peripheral 
neurotransmitters (such as calcitonin generelated peptide, substance 
P) in controlling sinoatrial node electrophysiology is unclear.

AtrioventricularJunctionalAreaand
IntraventricularConductionSystem
Atrioventricular Node
Based on histology and immunolabeling, the normal AV junctional 
area (Figs.  33-5 and 33-6) is composed of multiple distinct struc-
tures, including transitional tissue, inferior nodal extension, compact 
portion,  penetrating  bundle,  His  bundle,  atrial  and  ventricular 
muscle, central fibrous body, tendon of Todaro, and valves.10,11 Figure 
33-7A, B shows a computer-generated three-dimensional reconstruc-
tion of the AV junctional area in a rabbit heart. At the level of the AV 
junction, the tract of nodal tissue is divided into two major compo-
nents, the inferior nodal extension and the penetrating bundle (red 
and  purple  areas,  respectively,  in  Fig.  33-7A,  B).  The  inferior  nodal 
extension  is  located  between  the  coronary  sinus  and  the  tricuspid 
valve, and the end of the inferior nodal extension is covered by tran-
sitional tissue (light green area in Fig. 33-7A, B). The small myocytes 
in  the  inferior  nodal  extension  are  dispersed  among  connective 
tissue  and  do  not  express  connexin  43,  whereas  myocytes  in  the 
transitional zone do express connexin 43; however, unlike the con-
nexin 43positive atrial myocytes in the working myocardium, they 
are loosely packed between collagen septa. The inferior nodal exten-
sion is continuous with the penetrating bundle, which penetrates the 
fibrous tissue separating the atria and ventricles and emerges in the 
ventricles as the bundle of His. Both structures are covered by con-
nective  tissue  (sheaths  in  Fig.  33-7A)  and  are  therefore  enclosed. 
Myocytes  in  the  penetrating  bundle  express  connexin  43  and  are 
dispersed among connective tissue. A tract of connexin 43positive 
nodal  tissue  projects  into  the  connexin  43negative  inferior  nodal 
extension.

The compact portion of the AV node (yellow area in Fig. 33-7A, B) is 
a superficial structure lying just beneath the right atrial endocardium, 
anterior to the ostium of the coronary sinus, and directly above the 
insertion of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. It is at the apex 
of a triangle formed by the tricuspid annulus and the tendon of Todaro 
(blue  area  in  Fig.  33-7A,  B),  which  originates  in  the  central  fibrous 
body  and  passes  posteriorly  through  the  atrial  septum  to  continue 
with the eustachian valve (see Figs. 33-5 and 33-6A). The term triangle 
of  Koch,  however,  has  to  be  used  with  caution  because  histologic 
studies of anatomically normal adult hearts have demonstrated that 
the tendon of Todaro, which forms one side of the triangle of Koch, 
is absent in about two thirds of hearts. The compact node is located 
at the junction where the connexin 43negative nodal tissue (red area 
in Fig. 33-7A, B) meets the connexin 43positive nodal tissue (purple 
area  in  Fig.  33-7A,  B).  Myocytes  in  the  nodal  portion  are  small  and 
weakly  positive  for  connexin  43.  In  85%  to  90%  of  human  hearts, 
the  arterial  supply  to  the  AV  node  is  derived  from  a  branch  of  the 
right  coronary  artery  that  originates  at  the  posterior  intersection  of 
the AV and interventricular grooves (crux). A branch of the circumflex 
coronary  artery  provides  the  arterial  supply  to  the  AV  node  in  the 
remaining hearts. Fibers in the lower part of the AV node may exhibit 
automatic impulse formation.11 The main function of the AV node is 
to  delay  transmission  of  atrial  impulses  to  the  ventricles,  thereby 
coordinating atrial and ventricular contractions (Fig. 33-7C, D).
During normal anterograde AV conduction, the action potential prop-
agates  from  the  sinoatrial  node  through  atrial  working  myocardium 
(the existence of specialized internodal conduction pathways has been 
controversial) and enters the tract of nodal tissue at two points (see 
Fig. 33-7C; see also Video 33-1). The first point is at the end of the 
inferior  nodal  extension  (next  to  the  penetrating  bundle)  via  the   
transitional  tissue.  This  conduction  pathway  most  likely  corresponds 
to  the  fast-pathway  route  previously  observed  in  electrical  mapping 
experiments.11 Second, the action potential enters toward the begin-
ning of the inferior nodal extension. This conduction pathway prob-
ably constitutes the slow-pathway route. The action potential cannot 
enter  the  nodal  tissue  at  other  tissue  points  because  the  nodal  and 
atrial tissues are isolated from each other by a vein along this length

superiorly, by the fibrous commissure of the flap guarding the openings of the inferior 
vena cava and coronary sinus, by the attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid 
valve inferiorly, and by the mouth of the coronary sinus at the base. B, The stippled 
area adjacent to the central fibrous body is the approximate site of the compact AV

of tissue (dark green area in Fig. 33-7B, C). From the two entry points, 
the action potentials propagate both anterogradely and retrogradely 
along  the  inferior  nodal  extension  and  eventually  annihilate  each 
other. The action potential entering the nodal tract via the transitional 
zone  also  propagates  into  the  compact  node  and  then  reaches  the 
His bundle and propagates down the left and right bundle branches. 
Transmembrane  action  potentials  recorded  from  in  situ  cardiomyo-
cytes at various locations within the nodal tract exhibit distinct shapes 
and time courses (see Fig. 33-7D). Action potentials from extranodal 
atrial tissue and the His bundle (locations 1 and 5, respectively, in Fig. 
33-7C)  have  more  hyperpolarized  diastolic  potentials  and  faster 
upstrokes than do myocytes in the transitional zone (location 3) and 
penetrating  bundle  (location  4).  This  smaller  rate  of  depolarization 
results  in  slowing  of  conduction  across  the  compact  portion  and 
penetrating bundle (conduction velocity, <10 cm/sec versus 35 cm/sec 
in atrial working myocardium), thereby giving rise to the AV conduc-
tion delay.

Bundle of His (Penetrating Portion of the 
Atrioventricular Bundle)
This  structure  is  the  continuation  of  the  penetrating  bundle  on  the 
ventricular side of the AV junction before it divides to form the left 
and  right  bundles  (see  Fig.  33-6A).  Myocytes  in  the  His  bundle  are 
small and connexin 43 positive (see Fig. 33-7C). However, large, well-
formed  fasciculoventricular  connections  between  the  penetrating 
portion of the AV bundle and the ventricular septal crest are rarely 
found  in  adult  hearts.  Branches  from  the  anterior  and  posterior 
descending  coronary  arteries  supply  the  upper  muscular  interven-
tricular septum with blood, which makes the conduction system at 
this site more impervious to ischemic damage unless the ischemia is 
extensive.

Bundle Branches (Branching Portion of the 
Atrioventricular Bundle)
These structures begin at the superior margin of the muscular inter-
ventricular septum, immediately beneath the membranous septum, 
with cells of the left bundle branch cascading downward as a con-
tinuous sheet onto the septum beneath the noncoronary aortic cusp 
(Fig.  33-8A).  The  AV  bundle  may  then  give  off  other  left  bundle 
branches, sometimes constituting a true bifascicular system with an 
anterosuperior branch, in other hearts giving rise to a group of central 
fibers, and in still others appearing more as a network without clear 
division into a fascicular system (Fig. 33-8B). The right bundle branch 
continues intramyocardially as an unbranched extension of the AV 
bundle down the right side of the interventricular septum to the apex 
of  the  right  ventricle  and  base  of  the  anterior  papillary  muscle.  In 
some human hearts, the His bundle traverses the right interventricu-
lar crest and gives rise to a right-sided narrow stem origin of the left 
bundle  branch.  The  anatomy  of  the  left  bundle  branch  system  can 
be  variable  and  not  conform  to  a  constant  bifascicular  division. 
However, the concept of a trifascicular system remains useful to both 
electrocardiographers and clinicians (see Chapter 12).

Terminal Purkinje Fibers
These fibers connect with the ends of the bundle branches to form 
interweaving networks on the endocardial surface of both ventricles 
and transmit the cardiac impulse almost simultaneously to the entire 
right  and  left  ventricular  endocardium.  Purkinje  fibers  tend  to  be 
less  concentrated  at  the  base  of  the  ventricle  and  at  the  papillary 

muscle tips. They penetrate the myocardium for varying distances, 
depending on the animal species. In humans, they apparently pen-
etrate only the inner third of the endocardium, whereas in pigs, they 
almost  reach  the  epicardium.  Such  variations  could  influence 
changes  produced  by  myocardial  ischemia,  for  example,  because 
Purkinje  fibers  appear  to  be  more  resistant  to  ischemia  than  ordi-
nary myocardial fibers are. Purkinje myocytes are found in the His 
bundle  and  bundle  branches,  cover  much  of  the  endocardium  of 
both  ventricles  (see  Fig.  33-8B),  and  align  to  form  multicellular 
bundles  in  longitudinal  strands  separated  by  collagen.  Although 
conduction of cardiac impulses appears to be their major function, 
free-running  Purkinje  fibers  composed  of  many  Purkinje  cells  in  a 
series,  sometimes  called  false  tendons,  are  capable  of  contraction. 
Action  potentials  propagate  within  the  thin  Purkinje  fiber  bundles 
from the base to the apex before activation of the surrounding myo-
cytes occurs. Purkinje myocytes largely lack transverse tubules (Fig. 
e33-1), which reduces membrane capacitance and thus accelerates 
action  potential  propagation.12  Propagation  of  action  potentials 
within  the  His-Purkinje  system  and  working  myocardium  is  medi-
ated  by  connexins.  Ventricular  myocytes  express  mainly  connexin 
43, and Purkinje fibers express connexins 40 and 45. The molecular 
identity of the connexin type that enables transmission of impulses 
at the Purkinje fibermyocyte junction (PMJ) is unclear. It is also still 
not clear how the small amount of depolarizing current provided by 
the thin bundle of Purkinje fibers can activate a much larger mass of 
ventricular  muscle  (current-to-load  mismatch).13  It  is  possible  that 
individual  gap  junctional  channels  at  the  PMJ  are  formed  by  more 
than  one  connexin  isoform.  These  disparate  connexin  phenotypes 
may create specific types of hybrid channels with unique properties 
that ensure safe conduction at the PMJ. Because Purkinje cells have 
markedly longer repolarization times than surrounding myocytes do 
(see  Fig.  33-17E),  these  connexin  hybrids  could  also  decrease 
entrainment of repolarization at the PMJ and thereby increase repo-
larization gradients.

Pathways  of  Innervation.  The  AV  node  and  His  bundle  region 
are  innervated  by  a  rich  supply  of  cholinergic  and  adrenergic  fibers 
with densities exceeding those found in the ventricular myocardium.14

lack transverse tubuli. (From Cordeiro JM, Spitzer KW, Giles WR, et al: Location of the

innervation.  Despite 

affecting  the  sinoatrial  node  more 
than the AV node and the left sympa-
thetic  and  vagal  nerves  affecting  the 
AV  node  more  than  the  sinoatrial 
node. The distribution of neural input 
to  the  sinoatrial  and  AV  nodes  is 
complex  because  of  substantial  over-
lapping 
the 
overlap, specific branches of the vagal 
and sympathetic nerves can be shown 
to innervate certain regions preferen-
tially. Supersensitivity to acetylcholine 
follows vagal denervation. Stimulation 
of the right stellate ganglion produces 
sinus  tachycardia  with  less  effect  on 
AV nodal conduction, whereas stimu-
lation of the left stellate ganglion gen-
erally  produces  a  shift  in  the  sinus 
pacemaker  to  an  ectopic  site  and  
consistently  shortens  AV  nodal  con-
duction  time  and  refractoriness  but 
inconsistently  speeds  the  sinoatrial 
nodal  discharge  rate.  Stimulation  of 
the right cervical vagus nerve primarily 
slows  the  sinoatrial  nodal  discharge 
rate, and stimulation of the left vagus 
primarily  prolongs  AV  nodal  conduc-
tion time and refractoriness when sid-
edness is present. Neither sympathetic 
nor  vagal  stimulation  affects  normal 
conduction  in  the  His  bundle.  The 
negative dromotropic response of the 
heart to vagal stimulation is mediated 
by  the  activation  of  IK.Ach,Ade,  which 
results in hyperpolarization of the AV 
nodal cells and thereby influences the 
conductive  properties  of  the  node. 
The  positive  dromotropic  effect  of 
sympathetic  stimulation  arises  as  a 
consequence  of  an  increase  in  cyto-
solic cAMP levels and ensuing activa-
tion of the L-type Ca2+ current ICa.L (see 
Table 33-3).

Most efferent sympathetic impulses 
reach  the  canine  ventricles  over  the 
ansae  subclaviae,  branches  from  the 
stellate  ganglia.  Sympathetic  nerves 
then  synapse  primarily  in  the  caudal 
cervical  ganglia  and  form  individual 
cardiac nerves that innervate relatively 
localized  parts  of  the  ventricles.  The 
major route to the heart is the recur-
rent  cardiac  nerve  on  the  right  side 
and the ventrolateral cardiac nerve on 
the  left.  In  general,  the  right  sympa-
thetic  chain  shortens  refractoriness 
primarily of the anterior portion of the 
ventricles, and the left affects primar-
ily the posterior surface of the ventri-
cles,  although  overlapping  areas  of 
distribution occur.

Immunolabeling  with  markers  for  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic 
nerves revealed nonuniform innervation density in the AV junctional 
area.  For  example,  the  inferior  nodal  extension  has  been  shown  to 
exhibit a higher density of both nerve types than the working atrial 
myocardium  does,  whereas  the  opposite  is  true  for  the  compact 
node.15 Ganglia, nerve fibers, and nerve nets lie close to the AV node. 
Parasympathetic nerves to the AV node region enter the canine heart 
at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the inferior aspect of the 
left atrium, adjacent to the entrance to the coronary sinus. Nerves in 
direct  contact  with  AV  nodal  fibers  have  been  noted,  along  with 
agranular and granular vesicular processes, which presumably repre-
sent cholinergic and adrenergic processes.

In  general,  autonomic  neural  input  to  the  heart  exhibits  some 
degree of sidedness, with the right sympathetic and vagal nerves 

The intraventricular route of sympa-
thetic  nerves  generally  follows  the 
coronary  arteries.  Functional  data 
have suggested that afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves travel 
in the superficial layers of the epicardium and dive to innervate the 
endocardium, and anatomic observations have supported this conclu-
sion.  Vagal  fibers  travel  intramurally  or  subendocardially  and  rise  to 
the  epicardium  at  the  AV  groove  (Fig.  33-9A).  Sympathetic  nerve 
density in the left ventricle appears to be higher in the epicardial than 
in the endocardial portion of the ventricle, which at least in part results 
from  transmural  gradients  in  the  expression  of  cytokines  during 
cardiac development that attract and repel, respectively, sympathetic 
nerve growth (Fig. 33-9B).14,16

Effects of Vagal Stimulation.  The vagus modulates cardiac sym-
pathetic activity at prejunctional and postjunctional sites by regulating 
the  amount  of  norepinephrine  released  and  by  inhibiting  cAMP-
induced  phosphorylation  of  cardiac  proteins,  including  ion  channels

and calcium pumps. The latter inhibition occurs at more than one level 
in the series of reactions constituting the adenylate cyclase, cAMP-
dependent  protein  kinase  system.  Neuropeptides  released  from  the 
nerve  fibers  of  both  autonomic  limbs  also  modulate  autonomic 
responses. For example, NPY released from sympathetic nerve termi-
nals inhibits cardiac vagal effects.

Tonic vagal stimulation produces a greater absolute reduction in the 
sinoatrial rate in the presence of tonic background sympathetic stimu-
lation, a sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction termed accentuated 
antagonism. In contrast, changes in AV conduction during concomi-
tant  sympathetic  and  vagal  stimulation  are  essentially  the  algebraic 
sum  of  the  individual  AV  conduction  responses  to  tonic  vagal  and 
sympathetic stimulation alone. Cardiac responses to brief vagal bursts 
begin after a short latency and dissipate quickly; in contrast, cardiac 
responses to sympathetic stimulation commence and dissipate slowly. 
The  rapid  onset  and  offset  of  responses  to  vagal  stimulation  allow 
dynamic  beat-to-beat  vagal  modulation  of  the  heart  rate  and  AV 
conduction,  whereas  the  slow  temporal  response  to  sympathetic 

635

stimulation  precludes  any  beat-to-beat  regulation  by  sympathetic 
activity. Periodic vagal bursting, as may occur each time that a systolic 
pressure  wave  arrives  at  the  baroreceptor  regions  in  the  aortic  and 
carotid sinuses, induces phasic changes in sinus cycle length and can 
entrain the sinus node to discharge faster or slower at periods identical 
to those of the vagal burst. In a similar phasic manner, vagal bursts 
prolong AV nodal conduction time and are influenced by background 
levels  of  sympathetic  tone.  Because  the  peak  vagal  effects  on  sinus 
rate and AV nodal conduction occur at different times in the cardiac 
cycle, a brief vagal burst can slow the sinus rate without affecting AV 
nodal conduction or can prolong AV nodal conduction time and not 
slow the sinus rate. Bilateral but not unilateral vagal nerve stimulation 
increases and reverses the spatial dispersion of ventricular repolariza-
tion  as  the  direction  of  repolarization  from  the  apex  to  the  base  in 
sinus rhythm shifts from the base to the apex. This effect is attribut-
able to more pronounced prolongation of the action potential at the 
apex than at the base of the heart (Fig. e33-2).17

Effects  of  Sympathetic  Stimulation.  Similar  to  bilateral  vagal 
nerve  stimulation,  sympathetic  nerve  stimulation  also  increases  and 
reverses the spatial gradients of ventricular repolarization as the direc-
tion of polarization from the apex to the base in sinus rhythm shifts 
from the base to the apex. This reversal results from a marked shorten-
ing of action potential duration at the base, with no or very little effect 
on  the  repolarization  time  course  at  the  apex  of  the  heart  (see  Fig. 
e33-2).17  Nonuniform  distribution  of  sympathetic  nervesand  thus 
norepinephrine levelsmay in part contribute to some of the nonuni-
form  electrophysiologic  effects  because  the  ventricular  content  of 
norepinephrine is greater at the base than at the apex of the heart.11 
In  humans,  both  direct  and  reflex  sympathetic  stimulation  increases 
regional differences in cardiac repolarization. The dispersion of repo-
larization is significantly enhanced in patients with ischemic cardiomy-
opathy.18 Afferent vagal activity appears to be higher in the posterior 
ventricular  myocardium,  which  may  account  for  the  vagomimetic 
effects of inferior myocardial infarction.

The vagi exert minimal but measurable effects on ventricular tissue; 
they  decrease  the  strength  of  myocardial  contraction  and  prolong 
refractoriness. Under some circumstances, acetylcholine can cause a 
positive inotropic effect. It is now clear that the vagus (acetylcholine) 
can exert direct effects on some types of ventricular fibers, as well as 
indirect effects by modulating sympathetic influences.

Beyond  the  beat-to-beat  regulation  of  rate  and  contractile  force, 
sympathetic input to the heart, through both translational and post-
translational modifications, also exerts long-term regulation of adren-
ergic receptor sensitivity and ionic channels. These long-term changes 
in autonomic responsiveness and cardiac electrical properties appear 
to be mediated, at least in part, by highly localized signaling cascades 
involving neurally released molecules such as NPY.19

ArrhythmiasandtheAutonomic
NervousSystem
Alterations in vagal and sympathetic innervation (autonomic remod-
eling)  can  influence  the  development  of  arrhythmias  and  result  in 
sudden cardiac death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias.20 Damage 
to nerves extrinsic to the heart, such as the stellate ganglia, and to 
intrinsic  cardiac  nerves  from  diseases  that  may  affect  primarily 
nerves,  such  as  viral  infections,  or  from  diseases  that  secondarily 
cause cardiac damage may produce cardioneuropathy. Although the 
mechanisms  by  which  altered  sympathetic  innervation  modulates 
cardiac electrical properties are largely unknown, spatially heteroge-
neous  sympathetic  hyperinnervation  could  result  in  enhanced  dis-
persion  of  myocardial  excitability  and  refractoriness  via  patchy 
adrenergic stimulation of ionic currents, including ICa.L, IKs, and ICl (see 
Table 33-3). Sympathetic hypoinnervation has been shown to increase 
the  sensitivity  of  adrenergic  receptors  to  activation  by  circulating 
catecholamines (denervation supersensitivity).14

Numerous  studies  have  suggested  a  primary  role  of  altered  cardiac 
sympathetic  innervation  in  arrhythmogenesis.  Chronic  infusion  of 
nerve growth factor into the left stellate ganglion in dogs with chronic 
myocardial infarction and complete AV block caused spatially hetero-
geneous sympathetic cardiac hyperinnervation (nerve sprouting) and 
dramatically increased the incidence of sudden death from ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias.20  Ambulatory  long-term  recordings  of  left  stellate 
ganglion  nerve  activity  in  these  dogs  revealed  that  most  malignant 
ventricular arrhythmias were preceded by increased neuronal discharge,

thus  suggesting  a  causal  role  of  sympathetic  input  in  triggering 
arrhythmogenic sudden cardiac death.21 A high-cholesterol diet was 
reported to result in cardiac sympathetic hyperinnervation in rabbits 
and a marked increase in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF).22 
Explanted human hearts from transplant recipients with a history of 
arrhythmias exhibited a significantly higher and also more heteroge-
neous density of sympathetic nerve fibers than did those from patients 
without arrhythmias (Fig. 33-10A). Whether neural remodeling also 
involved parasympathetic nerve fibers in the heart was not examined 
in these studies. In patients with congestive heart failure, sympathetic 
neural tone is upregulated, and excess activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system leads to adverse myocardial effects, including lethal 
arrhythmias,  and  also  causes  depletion  of  cardiac  norepinephrine 
content. This depletion of norepinephrine has recently been shown to 
result,  at  least  partially,  from  neurotransmitter  switching  and 

transdifferentiation  from  catecholaminergic  into  cholinergic  neurons 
in the chronically failing heart (Fig. 33-10B).23 This process is induced 
by release of cholinergic differentiation factors from failing cardiomyo-
cytes. It remains to be determined, however, whether neurotransmit-
ter switching is an adaptive response to protect the heart from excess 
sympathetic  stimulation  and  thus  lethal  arrhythmias.  Interestingly, 
beta  adrenoceptor  blockade  in  rats  with  coronary  artery  ligation 
reversed the myocardial sympathetic axon depletion in intact myocar-
dium remote from the infarct but did not affect peri-infarct sympa-
thetic hyperinnervation.24 The junctions between pulmonary veins and 
the left atrium are highly innervated structures. Both sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nerves are colocated and concentrated in ganglion-
ated  plexuses  around  the  pulmonary  veins.25  Selective  ablation  of 
ganglionated plexuses, as well as extensive regional ablation targeting 
anatomic areas containing ganglionated plexuses, has been shown to 

reduce the incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in both clini-
cal and experimental studies, thus further supporting a causal involve-
ment of autonomic nerve activity in atrial arrhythmogenesis.26,27 On 
the other hand, spatially heterogeneous sympathetic denervation was 
similarly  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  atrial  and  ventricular 
arrhythmias.  Mutations  in  genes  encoding  cardiac  ion  channel  sub-
units also affect channel function in the central and peripheral auto-
nomic nervous system and thereby result in abnormal firing properties 
of  affected  neurons.28,29  This  observation  may  partially  explain  the 
clinical finding that sudden cardiac death in some variants of long-QT 
syndrome (LQTS; see Chapters 32, 34, and 37) is typically preceded 
by  sympathetic  arousal.  Also,  the  antiarrhythmic  efficacy  of  surgical 
left  cardiac  sympathetic  denervation  has  previously  been  demon-
strated  in  young  patients  with  catecholaminergic  polymorphic  ven-
tricular tachycardia (CPVT), an inherited arrhythmia caused by missense 
mutations in the gene encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca2+ 
release channel.30 Thus the cardiac sympathetic nervous system pro-
vides a potentially useful target for treating patients at risk for clinical 
arrhythmias.31

BASICELECTROPHYSIOLOGICPRINCIPLES

Physiology of Ion Channels
Electrical signaling in the heart involves the passage of ions through 
ionic channels. The Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl ions are the major charge 
carriers, and their movement across the cell membrane creates a flow 
of current that generates excitation and signals in cardiac myocytes. 
Ion channels are macromolecular pores that span the lipid bilayer of 
the  cell  membrane  (Fig.  33-11).  Conformational  transitions  change 
(gate) a single ion channel from closed to open, which allows selected 
ions to flow passively down the electrochemical activity gradient at a 
very  high  rate  (>106  ions  per  second).  The  high  transfer  rates  and 
restriction to downhill fluxes not stoichiometrically coupled to the 
hydrolysis of energy-rich phosphates distinguish ionic channel mecha-
nisms  from  those  of  other  ion-transporting  structures,  such  as   
sarcolemmal Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) or sarcoplas-
mic  reticular  Mg2+,Ca2+-ATPase  (SERCA).  Ion  channels  may  be 
gated by extracellular and intracellular ligands, changes in transmem-
brane voltage, or mechanical stress (see Table 33-3). Gating of single 
ion  channels  can  best  be  studied  by  means  of  the  patch-clamp 
technique.

FIGURE33-11  Structure of ion channels. Voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels 
are  composed  of  a  single  tetramer  consisting  of  four  covalently  linked  repeats  of 
the  six  transmembranespanning  motifs,  whereas  voltage-gated  K+  channels  are 
composed of four separate subunits, each containing a single six transmembrane
spanning  motif.  Inwardly  rectifying  K+  channels  are  formed  by  inward  rectifier  K+ 
channel pore-forming (alpha) subunits. In contrast to voltage-gated K+ channel alpha 
subunits,  the  Kir  alpha  subunits  have  only  two  (not  six)  transmembrane  domains.

Ion channels are usually named after the strongest permeant ion
Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Clbut some channels are less selective or are not 
selective,  as  in  gap  junctional  channels.  Channels  have  also  been 
named after neurotransmitters, as in acetylcholine-sensitive K+ chan-
nels, IK.Ach.

The ionic permeability ratio is a commonly used quantitative index 
of a channels selectivity. It is defined as the ratio of the permeability 
of one ion type to that of the main permeant ion type. Permeability 
ratios  of  voltage-gated  K+  and  Na+  channels  for  monovalent  and 
divalent (e.g., Ca2+) cations are usually less than 1:10. Voltage-gated 
Ca2+  channels  exhibit  a  more  than  1000-fold  discrimination  against 
Na+ and K+ ions (e.g., PK/PCa = 1/3000) and are impermeable to anions.
Because ions are charged, net ionic flux through an open channel 
is determined by both the concentration and electrical gradient across 
the membrane (electrodiffusion). The potential at which the passive 
flux of ions along the chemical driving force is exactly balanced by the 
electrical driving force is called the reversal or Nernst potential of the 
channel. In the case of a channel that is perfectly selective for one ion 
species, the reversal potential equals the thermodynamic equilibrium 
potential of that ion, ES, which is given by the Nernst equation in the 
form

where [Si] and [So] are the intracellular and extracellular concentrations 
of the permeant ion, respectively, z is the valence of the ion, R is the 
gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, T is the temperature (kelvin), 
and  ln  is  the  logarithm  to  the  base  e.  At  membrane  voltages  more 
positive than the reversal potential of the channel, passive ion move-
ment is outward, whereas it is inward at membrane potentials more 
negative  than  the  Nernst  potential  of  that  channel.  If  the  current 
through an open channel is carried by more than one permeant ion, 
the  reversal  potential  becomes  a  weighted  mean  of  all  Nernst 
potentials.

Membrane  voltages  during  a  cardiac  action  potential  are  in  the 
range  of 94  to +30 mV  (Table  33-1).  With  physiologic  external  K+ 
(4 mM),  EK  is  approximately  91 mV,  and  passive  movement  of  K+ 
during  an  action  potential  is  out  of  the  cell.  On  the  other  hand, 
because the calculated reversal potential of a cardiac Ca2+ channel is 
+64 mV  (assuming  that  PK/PCa =  1/3000,  Ki =  150 mM,  Ko =  4 mM, 
Cai = 100 nM, and Cao = 2 mM), passive Ca2+ flux is into the cell. With 
physiologic internal and external chloride concentrations, ECl is 83 to 
36 mV,  and  passive  movement  of  Cl  ions  through  open  chloride 
channels  can  be  both  inward  and  outward  at  membrane  potentials 
typically occurring during a cardiac action potential. In more general 
terms, the direction and magnitude of passive ion flux through a single 
open channel at any given transmembrane voltage are governed by 
the  reversal  potential  of  that  ion  and  its  concentration  on  the  two 
sides of the membrane, with the net flux being larger when ions move 
from the more concentrated side.

Ion Flux Through Voltage-Gated Channels.  Changes in trans-
membrane potential determine ion flux through voltage-gated chan-
nels, not only through the voltage dependence of the electrochemical 
driving force on the permeant ion but also through the voltage depen-
dence of channel activation; that is, the fraction of time that a channel 
permits ions to permeate is determined by the membrane voltage. If 
the probability of a channel being activated (i.e., the open-state prob-
ability  of  that  channel)  exhibits  voltage  dependence,  as  is  the  case 
with the fast Na+ channel or voltage-dependent K+ channels in cardiac 
myocytes,  activation  increases  with  membrane  depolarization.  Note 
that  channels  do  not  have  a  sharp  voltage  threshold  for  opening. 
Rather, dependence of channel activation on membrane potential is 
a continuous function of voltage and follows a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 
33-12, blue curve). The potential at which activation is half-maximal 
and  the  steepness  of  the  activation  curve  determine  the  channels 
activity during changes in membrane potential. Shifting the activation 
curve to potentials positive to the midpoint of activation and reducing 
the steepness of the channels activation curve are two possible mech-
anisms  by  which  ion  channel  blockers  can  inhibit  ion  channel 
activity.

As indicated in Figure 33-13, open channels enter a nonconducting 
conformation  after  a  depolarizing  change  in  membrane  potential,  a 
process termed inactivation. If membrane depolarization persists, the 
channel  remains  inactivated  and  cannot  reopen.  This  steady-state 
inactivation  increases  with  membrane  depolarization  in  a  sigmoidal 
fashion (see Fig. 33-12, gold curve). Inactivation curves of the various 
voltage-gated ion channel types in the heart differ in their slopes and

FIGURE 33-12  Voltage  dependence  of  fast  Na+  current  steady-state  activation 
(blue)  and  steady-state  inactivation  (gold).  Fractional  activation  and  inactivation  (y 
axis) are plotted as a function of membrane potential. The inactivation and activation 
curves overlap within a voltage range from approximately 60 to approximately 0 mV, 
which demarcates the voltage range of the noninactivating Na+ window current. 

midpoints  of  inactivation.  For  example,  sustained  cardiomyocyte 
membrane depolarization to 50 mV (as may occur in acutely ischemic 
myocardium) causes almost complete inactivation of the fast voltage-
gated  Na+  channel  (see  Fig.  33-12,  gold  curve),  whereas  the  L-type 
Ca2+ channel exhibits only little inactivation at this membrane poten-
tial.  Activation  and  inactivation  curves  can  overlap,  in  which  case  a 
steady-state or noninactivating current flows. The existence of such a 
window current has been verified for both the voltage-gated Na+ 
current32 and the L-type Ca2+ current. The L-type Ca2+ current and the 
fast Na+ window current have been implicated in the genesis of trig-
gered activity arising from early afterdepolarization (EAD) and delayed 
afterdepolarization (DAD).33

Channels recover from inactivation and then enter the closed state, 
from which they can be reactivated (see Fig. 33-13). Rates of recovery 
from inactivation vary among the different types of voltage-dependent 
channels  and  usually  follow  monoexponential  or  multiexponential 
time  courses,  with  the  longest  time  constants  ranging  from  a  few 
milliseconds, for example, as for the fast sodium channel, to several 
seconds,  as  for  some  subtypes  of  K+  channels  (see  Table  33-3). 
Together,  the  activity  of  voltage-dependent  ion  channels  in  cardio-
myocytes over the course of an action potential is tightly regulated by 
the orchestrated interplay of a number of time- and voltage-dependent 
gating  mechanisms,  including  activation,  inactivation,  and  recovery 
from  inactivation.  All  these  mechanisms  represent  potential  targets 
for pharmacologic intervention.

Principles of Ionic Current Modulation.  The whole-cell current 
amplitude I is the product of the number of functional channels in the 
membrane  available  for  opening  (N),  the  probability  that  a  channel 
will open (Po), and the single-channel current amplitude (i), or I = N  
Po    i.  Modulation  of  current  amplitudes  in  single  cardiomyocytes 
therefore  results  from  alterations  in  N,  Po,  i,  or  any  combination  of 
these factors. Changes in the number of available channels in the cell

membrane  may  result  from  alterations  in  the  expression  of  ion 
channelencoding  genes.  The  magnitude  of  the  single-channel 
current  amplitude  is  dependent,  among  other  factors,  on  the  ionic 
concentration gradient across the membrane. For example, an increase 
in  the  extracellular  Ca2+  concentration  increases  current  through  a 
single  Ca2+  channel.  Changes  in  channel  activation  can  result  from 
phosphorylation  or  dephosphorylation  of  the  channel  protein  by 
second messengermediated activation of protein kinases and protein 
phosphatases, respectively. Channel phosphorylation or dephosphor-
ylation  causes  a  shift  in  the  membrane  potential  dependence  of  a 
channels activation or availability curve, or both, or modification of 
the  sensitivity  of  channel  activation  or  inactivation  to  changes  in 
membrane potential. For example, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IImediated 
phosphorylation  shifts  the  activation  curve  of  the  cardiac  sodium 
current to more negative potentials.34

Molecular Structure of Ion Channels.  Electrophysiologic studies 
have detailed the functional properties of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ currents 
in cardiomyocytes, and molecular cloning has revealed a large number 
of pore-forming (alpha) and auxiliary (beta, delta, and gamma) sub-
units thought to contribute to formation of the cell surface ion chan-
nels. These studies have demonstrated that distinct molecular entities 
give rise to the various cardiac ion channels and shape the myocardial 
action potential. It has also been demonstrated that mutations in the 
genes  encoding  subunits  underlying  functional  cardiac  ion  channels 
are responsible for several inherited cardiac arrhythmias (see Chapter 
32).35  The  expression  and  functional  properties  of  myocardial  ion 
channels  also  change  in  a  number  of  acquired  disease  states,  and 
these alterations can predispose to cardiac arrhythmias.36,37

A  more  detailed  description  of  the  molecular  composition  of 
sodium,  calcium,  potassium,  and  pacemaker  channels  is  provided 
online at ExpertConsult.

Intercalated Discs
Another  family  of  ion  channel  proteins  is  that  containing  the  gap 
junctional  channels.  These  dodecameric  channels  are  found  in  the 
intercalated  discs  between  adjacent  cells.  Three  types  of  specialized 
junctions  make  up  each  intercalated  disc.  The  macula  adherens  or 
desmosome  and  the  fascia  adherens  form  areas  of  strong  adhesion 
between cells and may provide a linkage for the transfer of mechanical 
energy from one cell to the next. The nexus, also called the tight or 
gap  junction,  is  a  region  in  the  intercalated  disc  where  cells  are  in 
functional contact with each other. Membranes at these junctions are 
separated by only about 10 to 20 Å and are connected by a series of 
hexagonally packed subunit bridges. Gap junctions provide biochemi-
cal  and  low-resistance  electrical  coupling  between  adjacent  cells  by 

Gap junctions also provide biochemical coupling, which permits 
cell-to-cell movement of ATP (or other high-energy phosphates), cyclic 
nucleotides, and IP3, the activator of the IP3-sensitive SR Ca2+ release 
channel,39  thus  demonstrating  that  diffusion  of  second-messenger 
substances through gap junctional channels constitutes a mechanism 
enabling coordinated responses of the myocardial syncytium to physi-
ologic stimuli.

Gap junctions can also change their electrical resistance. When the 
intracellular  calcium  level  rises,  as  in  myocardial  infarction,  the  gap 
junction may close to help seal off the effects of injured from nonin-
jured cells. Acidosis increases and alkalosis decreases gap junctional 
resistance. Increased gap junctional resistance tends to slow the rate 
of action potential propagation, a condition that could lead to con-
duction delay or block. Cardiac-restricted inactivation of gap junctions 
decreases  transverse  conduction  velocity  to  a  greater  degree  than 
longitudinal conduction, thereby resulting in an increased anisotropic 
ratio, which may play a role in premature sudden death from ventricu-
lar arrhythmias.40

establishing aqueous pores that directly link the cytoplasm of these 
adjacent cells. Gap junctions allow the movement of ions (e.g., Na+, 
Cl, K+, Ca2+) and small molecules (e.g., cAMP, cyclic guanosine mono-
phosphate  [cGMP],  inositol  1,4,5-triphosphate  [IP3])  between  cells, 
thereby linking the interiors of adjacent cells.

Gap junctions permit a multicellular structure such as the heart to 
function electrically like an orderly, synchronized, interconnected unit 
and are probably responsible in part for the fact that conduction in 
the  myocardium  is  anisotropic;  that  is,  its  anatomic  and  biophysical 
properties vary according to the direction in which they are measured. 
Usually, conduction velocity is two to three times faster longitudinally, 
in the direction of the long axis of the fiber, than it is transversely, in 
the  direction  perpendicular  to  this  long  axis.38  Resistivity  is  lower 
longitudinally  than  transversely.  Interestingly,  the  safety  factor  for 
propagation is greater transversely than horizontally. The safety factor 
for conduction determines the success of action potential propagation 
and has been defined as the ratio of electrical charge that is generated 
to  charge  that  is  consumed  during  the  excitation  cycle  of  a  single 
myocyte in tissue.38 Conduction delay or block occurs more commonly 
in the longitudinal direction than it does transversely. Cardiac conduc-
tion is discontinuous because of resistive discontinuities created by the 
gap  junctions,  which  have  an  anisotropic  distribution  on  the  cell 
surface.38 Because of anisotropy, propagation is discontinuous and can 
be a cause of reentry.

Connexins are the proteins that form the intercellular channels of 
gap junctions. An individual channel is created by two hemichannels 
(connexons), each located in the plasma membrane of adjacent cells 
and composed of six integral membrane protein subunits (connexins). 
The  hemichannels  surround  an  aqueous  pore  and  thereby  create  a 
transmembrane channel (Fig. 33-14). Connexin 43, a 43-kDa polypep-
tide, is the most abundant cardiac connexin, with connexins 40 and 
45 being found in smaller amounts. Ventricular muscle expresses con-
nexins  43  and  45,  whereas  atrial  muscle  and  components  of  the 
specialized  conduction  system  express  connexins  43,  45,  and  40. 
Expression  of  connexin  30.2  appears  to  be  confined  to  the  cardiac 
conduction system.41 Individual cardiac connexins form gap junctional 
channels  with  characteristic  unitary  conductances,  voltage  sensitivi-
ties, and permeabilities. Tissue-specific connexin expression and the 
spatial distribution of gap junctions determine the disparate conduc-
tion properties of cardiac tissue (see Fig. 33-7). The functional diversity 
of cardiac gap junctions is further enhanced by the ability of different 
connexin isoforms to form hybrid gap junctional channels with unique 
electrophysiologic properties. These channel chimeras appear to have 
a major function in controlling impulse transmission at the sinoatrial 
nodeatrium border, the atriumAV node transitional zone, and the 
Purkinje-myocyte border.5

Alterations in the distribution and function of cardiac gap junctions 
are  associated  with  increased  susceptibility  to  arrhythmias.  Conduc-
tion slowing and arrhythmogenesis have been associated with redis-
tribution of connexin 43 gap junctions from the end of cardiomyocytes 
to the lateral borders and with decreased phosphorylation of connexin 
43 in a dog model of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.42,43 Adult 
mice genetically engineered to express progressively decreasing levels 
of cardiac connexin 43 exhibited increased susceptibility to the induc-
tion  of  fatal  tachyarrhythmias.44,45  Side-to-side  electrical  coupling 
between cardiomyocytes from the epicardial border zone of healing 
infarcts has been shown to be reduced, thereby exaggerating anisot-
ropy and facilitating reentrant activity.46 Finally, a rare single nucleo-
tide  polymorphism  in  the  atrial-specific  connexin  40  gene  has  been 
found to increase the risk for idiopathic AF.47 Studies have suggested

that  normal  electrical  coupling  of  cardiomyocytes  via  gap  junctions 
depends  on  normal  mechanical  coupling  via  cell-cell  adhesion  junc-
tions.48 A defect in cell-cell adhesion or a discontinuity in the linkage 
between intercellular junctions and the cytoskeleton prevents normal 
localization  of  connexins  in  gap  junctions,  which  in  turn  could  con-
tribute to sudden death from tachyarrhythmias. For example, Carvajal 
syndrome is caused by a recessive mutation in desmoplakin, a protein 
that  links  desmosomal  adhesion  molecules  to  desmin,  a  filament 
protein of the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton.49 Naxos disease is caused 
by  a  recessive  mutation  in  plakoglobin,  a  protein  that  connects 
N-cadherins to actin and desmosomal cadherins to desmin.50 Approxi-
mately 70% of the mutations linked to familial arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular cardiomyopathy are in the gene encoding the desmosomal 
protein plakophilin 2. Recent experiments have demonstrated that loss 
of plakophilin 2 expression leads to redistribution of connexin 43 to 
the intracellular space of cardiomyocytes, loss of gap junction plaques, 
and reduced functional coupling between cells.51 Further demonstra-
tion of the important role of other adhesion proteins in stabilizing gap 
junctions comes from a study wherein conditional loss of N-cadherin 
expression in mouse hearts resulted in a decrease in connexin 43 gap 
junctions  and  changes  in  conduction  velocity  with  a  concomitant 
increase in arrhythmogenicity (Fig. e33-3).40

PhasesoftheCardiacActionPotential
The cardiac transmembrane action potential consists of five phases: 
phase 0, upstroke or rapid depolarization; phase 1, early rapid repo-
larization; phase 2, plateau; phase 3, final rapid repolarization; and 
phase  4,  resting  membrane  potential  and  diastolic  depolarization 
(Figs. 33-15 and 33-16). These phases are the result of passive ion 
fluxes  moving  down  the  electrochemical  gradients  established  by 
active  ion  pumps  and  exchange  mechanisms.  Each  ion  moves  pri-
marily through its own ion-specific channel. The following discussion 
explains the electrogenesis of each of these phases.

General Considerations.  Ionic fluxes regulate membrane poten-
tial in cardiac myocytes in the following fashion. When only one type 
of ion channel opens, assuming that this channel is perfectly selective 
for  that  ion,  the  membrane  potential  of  the  entire  cell  would  equal 
the  Nernst  potential  of  that  ion.  By  solving  the  Nernst  equation  for 
the four major ions across the plasma membrane, the following equi-
librium potentials are obtained: sodium, +60 mV; potassium, 94 mV; 
calcium,  +129 mV;  and  chloride,  83  to  36 mV  (see  Table  33-1). 
Therefore, if a single K+-selective channel opens, such as the inwardly 
rectifying  K+  channel,  the  membrane  potential  approaches  EK 
(94 mV). If a single Na+-selective channel opens, the transmembrane 
potential becomes ENa (+60 mV). A quiescent cardiac myocyte (phase 
4)  has  many  more  open  potassium  than  sodium  channels,  and  the

FIGURE33-16  Currents and channels involved in generating resting and action 
potentials. The time course of a stylized action potential of atrial and ventricular cells 
is shown on the left, and that of sinoatrial node cells is on the right. Above and 
below are the various channels and pumps that contribute the currents underlying 
the electrical events. See Table 33-3 for identification of the symbols and description 
of  the  channels  or  currents.  Where  possible,  the  approximate  time  courses  of  the 
currents associated with the channels or pumps are shown symbolically without try-
ing to represent their magnitudes relative to each other. IK incorporates at least two 
currents, IKr and IKs. There appears to be an ultrarapid component as well, designated 
IKur. The heavy bars for ICL, Ipump, and IK.ATP indicate only the presence of these chan-
nels or pump without implying magnitude of currents because the magnitude would 
vary  with  physiologic  and  pathophysiologic  conditions.  The  channels  identified  by 
brackets (INS and IK.ATP) are active only under pathologic conditions. INS may represent 
a swelling-activated cation current. For the sinoatrial node cells, INS and IK1 are small 
or absent. Question marks indicate that experimental evidence is not yet available to 
determine the presence of these channels in sinoatrial cell membranes. Although it 
is likely that other ionic current mechanisms exist, they are not shown here because 
their roles in electrogenesis are not sufficiently well defined. (From Members of the 
Sicilian Gambit: Antiarrhythmic Therapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach. Mount Kisco,

cells transmembrane potential is close to EK (Table 33-2). When two 
or more types of ion channels open simultaneously, each type tries to 
make the membrane potential go to the equilibrium potential of that 
channel. The contribution of each ion type to the overall membrane 
potential  at  any  given  moment  is  determined  by  the  instantaneous 
permeability of the plasma membrane to that ion. For example, devia-
tion of the measured resting membrane potential from EK (see Table 
33-1) would predict that other ion types with equilibrium potentials 
positive to EK are contributing to the resting membrane potential in 
cardiac  myocytes.  If  it  is  assumed  that  Na+,  K+,  and  Cl  are  the 

permeant ions at resting potential, their individual contributions to the 
resting  membrane  potential  V  can  be  quantified  by  the  Goldman
HodgkinKatz voltage equation in the form

where the symbols have the meanings outlined previously. With only 
one permeant ion, V becomes the Nernst potential for that ion. With 
several  permeant  ion  types,  V  is  a  weighted  mean  of  all  the  Nernst 
potentials.

Intracellular electrical activity can be recorded by inserting a glass 
microelectrode filled with an electrolyte solution and with a tip diam-
eter  smaller  than  0.5 µm  into  a  single  cell.  The  electrode  produces 
minimal damage, its entry point apparently being sealed by the cell. 
The  transmembrane  potential  is  recorded  by  using  this  electrode  in 
reference to an extracellular ground electrode placed in the tissue bath 
near  the  cell  membrane  and  represents  the  potential  difference 
between intracellular and extracellular voltage (see Fig. 33-15). Alter-
natively,  the  patch-clamp  technique  in  current  clamp  mode  can  be 
used to measure transmembrane potentials.

Phase 4: Resting Membrane Potential.  The intracellular poten-
tial during electrical quiescence in diastole is 50 to 95 mV, depend-
ing  on  the  type  of  cell  (see  Table  33-2).  Therefore  the  inside  of  the 
cell is 50 to 95 mV negative relative to the outside of the cell because 
of the distribution of ions such as K+, Na+, and Cl.

Because cardiac myocytes have an abundance of open K+ channels 
at rest, the cardiac transmembrane potential (in phase 4) is close to 
EK.  Potassium  outward  current  through  open,  inwardly  rectifying  K+ 
channels (IKl) under normal conditions contributes to the resting mem-
brane potential mainly in atrial and ventricular myocytes, as well as in 
Purkinje cells. Deviation of the resting membrane potential from EK is 
the result of movement of monovalent ions with an equilibrium poten-
tial  greater  than  the  EK,  for  example,  Cl  efflux  through  activated 
chloride channels, such as ICl.cAMP, ICl.Ca, and ICl.swell. Calcium does not 
contribute directly to the resting membrane potential, but changes in 
intracellular  free  calcium  concentration  can  affect  other  membrane 
conductance values. For example, an increase in sarcoplasmic reticu-
lum  (SR)  Ca2+  load  can  cause  spontaneous  intracellular  Ca2+  waves, 
which in turn activate the Ca2+-dependent chloride conductance ICl.Ca 
and thereby lead to spontaneous transient inward currents and con-
comitant  membrane  depolarization.52  Increases  in  [Ca2+]i  can  also 
stimulate the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger INa/Ca. This protein exchanges three 
Na+ ions for one Ca2+ ion; the direction is dependent on the sodium 
and calcium concentrations on the two sides of the membrane and 
the transmembrane potential difference. At resting membrane poten-
tial and during a spontaneous SR Ca2+ release event, this exchanger 
would generate a net Na+ influx, possibly causing transient membrane 
depolarizations (see Fig. 33-20).53 [Ca2+]i has also been shown to acti-
vate IKl in cardiac myocytes, thereby indirectly contributing to cardiac 
resting membrane potential. Because of the Na-K pump, which pumps 
Na+ out of the cell against its electrochemical gradient and simultane-
ously pumps K+ into the cell against its chemical gradient, the intracel-
lular  K+  concentration  remains  high  and  the  intracellular  Na+ 
concentration  remains  low.  This  pump,  fueled  by  an  Na+,K+-ATPase 
enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP for energy, is bound to the membrane. 
It requires both Na+ and K+ to function and can transport three Na+ 
ions  outward  for  two  K+  ions  inward.  Therefore  the  pump  can  be 
electrogenic  and  generate  a  net  outward  movement  of  positive 
charges.  The  rate  of  Na+-K+  pumping  to  maintain  the  same  ionic 
gradients  must  increase  as  the  heart  rate  increases  because  the  cell 
gains a slight amount of Na+ and loses a slight amount of K+ with each 
depolarization.  Cardiac  glycosideinduced  block  of  Na+,K+-ATPase 
increases contractility through an increase in intracellular Na+ concen-
tration,  which  in  turn  reduces  Ca2+  extrusion  through  the  Na+/Ca2+ 
exchanger (see later) and ultimately increases myocyte contractility.53
Phase  0:  Upstroke  or  Rapid  Depolarization.  A  stimulus  deliv-
ered to excitable tissue evokes an action potential characterized by a 
sudden change in voltage caused by transient depolarization followed 
by  repolarization.  The  action  potential  is  conducted  throughout  the 
heart  and  is  responsible  for  initiating  each  heartbeat.  Electrical 
changes in action potential follow a relatively fixed time and voltage 
relationship that differs according to specific cell types (Fig. 33-17). 
In nerve, the entire process takes several milliseconds, whereas action 
potentials in human cardiac fibers last several hundred milliseconds. 
Normally, the action potential is independent of the size of the depo-
larizing  stimulus  if  the  latter  exceeds  a  certain  threshold  potential. 
Small subthreshold depolarizing stimuli depolarize the membrane in

proportion to the strength of the stimulus. However, when the stimu-
lus is sufficiently intense to reduce membrane potential to a threshold 
value in the range of 70 to 65 mV for normal Purkinje fibers, more 
intense stimuli do not produce larger action potential responses, and 
an all-or-none response results. In contrast, hyperpolarizing pulses, 
stimuli  that  render  the  membrane  potential  more  negative,  elicit  a 
response proportional to the strength of the stimulus.

Mechanism of Phase 0.  The upstroke of the cardiac action poten-
tial in atrial and ventricular muscle and His-Purkinje fibers is the result 
of a sudden increase in membrane conductance of Na+. An externally 
applied stimulus or a spontaneously generated local membrane circuit 
current  in  advance  of  a  propagating  action  potential  depolarizes  a 
sufficiently large area of membrane at a sufficiently rapid rate to open 
the  Na+  channels  and  depolarize  the  membrane  further.  When  the 
stimulus activates enough Na+ channels, Na+ ions enter the cell down 
their  electrochemical  gradient.  The  excited  membrane  no  longer 
behaves like a K+ electrode, that is, exclusively permeable to K+, but 
more  closely  approximates  an  Na+  electrode,  and  the  membrane 
moves toward the Na+ equilibrium potential.

The  rate  at  which  depolarization  occurs  during  phase  0,  that  is,   
the maximum rate of change in voltage over time, is indicated by the 
expression dV/dtmax or  (cid:31)Vmax  (see Table 33-2), which is a reasonable 
approximation  of  the  rate  and  magnitude  of  Na+  entry  into  the  cell 

and a determinant of conduction velocity for the propagated action 
potential. The transient increase in sodium conductance lasts 1 to 2 
milliseconds. The action potential, or more properly the Na+ current 
(INa),  is  said  to  be  regenerative;  that  is,  intracellular  movement  of  a 
little  Na+  depolarizes  the  membrane  more,  which  increases  conduc-
tance of Na+ more and allows more Na+ to enter, and so on. As this 
process is occurring, however, [Na+]i and positive intracellular charges 
increase and reduce the driving force for Na+. When the equilibrium 
potential for Na+ (ENa) is reached, Na+ no longer enters the cell; that 
is, when the driving force acting on the ion to enter the cell balances 
the driving force acting on the ion to exit the cell, no current flows. 
In addition, Na+ conductance is time dependent, so when the mem-
brane  spends  some  time  at  voltages  less  negative  than  the  resting 
potential, Na+ conductance decreases (inactivation; see earlier). There-
fore an intervention that reduces membrane potential for a time (acute 
myocardial  ischemia),  but  not  to  threshold,  partially  inactivates  Na+ 
channels,  and  if  the  threshold  is  now  achieved,  the  magnitude  and 
rate  of  Na+  influx  are  reduced,  which  causes  conduction  velocity  to 
slow.

In  cardiac  Purkinje  fibers,  sinoatrial  cells,  and  to  a  lesser  extent, 
ventricular  muscle,  two  different  populations  of  Na+  channels  exist: 
the  tetrodotoxin  (TTX)-sensitive,  neuronal  Na+  channel  isoform 
(Nav1.1)  and  the  TTX-resistant  Nav1.5  isoform,  the  latter  being  the

predominant isoform in cardiac muscle. Although the precise role of 
Nav1.1 channels in ventricular or atrial cardiomyocytes has not been 
defined,  this  channel  is  an  important  modulator  of  sinoatrial  node 
pacemaking54  and  in  determining  Purkinje  myocyte  action  potential 
duration.

Upstroke of the Action Potential.  In normal atrial and ventricu-
lar muscle and in fibers in the His-Purkinje system, action potentials 
have  very  rapid  upstrokes  with  a  large  (cid:31)Vmax   and  are  called  fast 
responses.  Action  potentials  in  the  normal  sinoatrial  and  AV  nodes 
and  many  types  of  diseased  tissue  have  very  slow  upstrokes  with  a 
reduced  (cid:31)Vmax  and are called slow responses (Table 33-3; see also 
Figs. 33-4, 33-7, and 33-17). Upstrokes of slow responses are medi-
ated by a slow inward, predominantly L-type voltage-gated (Cav) Ca2+ 
current (ICa.L) rather than by the fast inward INa. These potentials have 
been termed slow response potentials because the time required for 
activation and inactivation of the slow inward current (ICa.L) is approxi-
mately  an  order  of  magnitude  slower  than  that  for  the  fast  inward 
Na+ current (INa). Recovery from inactivation also takes longer. Calcium 
entry and [Ca2+]i help promote inactivation. The slow channel requires 
more time after a stimulus to be reactivated. In fact, recovery of excit-
ability outlasts full restoration of maximum diastolic potential, which 
means  that  even  though  the  membrane  potential  has  returned  to 
normal, the cell has not recovered excitability completely because the 
latter depends on the elapse of a certain amount of time (i.e., is time 
dependent) and not just on recovery of a particular membrane poten-
tial (i.e., voltage dependent), a phenomenon termed postrepolariza-
tion refractoriness.

The threshold for activation of ICa.L, that is, the voltage that the cell 
must  reach  to  turn  on  the  slow  inward  current,  is  about  30  to 
40 mV. In fibers of the fast response type, ICa.L is normally activated 
during  phase  0  by  the  regenerative  depolarization  caused  by  the   
fast sodium current. Current flows through both fast and slow chan-
nels during the latter part of the action potential upstroke. However, 
ICa.L  is  much  smaller  than  the  peak  Na+  current  and  therefore 
contributes  little  to  the  action  potential  until  the  fast  Na+  current  is 
inactivated after completion of phase 0. Thus ICa.L affects mainly the 
plateau of action potentials recorded in atrial and ventricular muscle 
and  His-Purkinje  fibers.  In  addition,  ICa.L  may  play  a  prominent  role 
in  partially  depolarized  cells  in  which  the  fast  Na+  channels  have 
been  inactivated  if  conditions  are  appropriate  for  slow-channel 
activation.

Ca2+ entry through activated L-type Cav channels triggers release of 
Ca2+ from SR stores and is an essential component of cardiac excitation-
contraction  coupling  in  atrial  and  ventricular  myocardium  (see 
Chapter 21). L-type Cav channels are also expressed in sinoatrial and 
AV nodal cells, where they play a role in controlling automaticity and 
action  potential  propagation,  respectively.  Cardiac  L-type  Cav  chan-
nels undergo rapid voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation, the time 
course  of  which  importantly  affects  the  action  potential  waveform 
and the time course of repolarization. Although T-type Cav channels 
have not been detected in human myocardium, experimental evidence 
in animals has suggested that these channels play an important role 
in  determining  sinoatrial  node  automaticity  and  AV  nodal  conduc-
tion.30 Whether Ca2+ influx through open T-type channels provides a 
sufficient trigger for release of Ca2+ from the SR is controversial. The 
density  of  T-type  Ca2+  channels  has  been  found  to  be  increased  in 
myocytes from hearts with experimentally induced hypertrophy, but 
the role of enhanced T-type channel density under these conditions 
remains to be determined.

Other significant differences exist between the fast and slow chan-
nels.  Drugs  that  elevate  cAMP  levels,  such  as  beta  adrenoceptor 
agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as theophylline, and the 
lipid-soluble derivative of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, increase ICa.L. Binding 
of  the  beta  adrenoceptor  agonist  to  specific  sarcolemmal  receptors 
facilitates the dissociation of two subunits of a regulatory protein (G 
protein;  see  Chapter  21),  one  of  which  (Gs)  activates  adenylate 
cyclase and thus increases intracellular levels of cAMP. The latter binds 
to  a  regulatory  subunit  of  a  cAMP-dependent  protein  kinase  that 
promotes  phosphorylation  of  specific  phosphorylation  sites  on  the 
channel protein, which ultimately results in an enhanced open-state 
probability  of  the  channel.  Although  Nav  channels  are  sensitive  to 
increases in cAMP, the net effect (decrease versus increase) appears 
to be species dependent.

Acetylcholine reduces ICa.L by decreasing adenylate cyclase activity. 
However, acetylcholine stimulates the accumulation of cGMP. cGMP 
has negligible effects on basal ICa.L but decreases the ICa.L levels that 
have been elevated by beta adrenoceptor agonists. This effect is medi-
ated by cAMP hydrolysis through a cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide 
phosphodiesterase.

Differences Between Channels.  Fast and slow channels can be 
differentiated  on  the  basis  of  their  pharmacologic  sensitivity.  Drugs 
that block the slow channel with a fair degree of specificity include 
verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem, and D-600 (a methoxy derivative of 
verapamil).  Antiarrhythmic  agents  such  as  lidocaine,  quinidine,  pro-
cainamide, and disopyramide (see Chapter 35) affect the fast channel 
and not the slow channel.

Normal  action  potentials  recorded  from  the  sinus  node  and  the 
compact node of the AV junction have a reduced resting membrane 
potential, action potential amplitude, overshoot, upstroke, and con-
duction velocity when compared with action potentials in muscle or 
Purkinje fibers (see Figs. 33-7 and 33-17).

Slow-channel blockers suppress sinus and AV nodal action poten-
tials. The prolonged time for reactivation of ICa.L probably accounts for 
the  fact  that  sinoatrial  and  AV  nodal  cells  remain  refractory  longer 
than the time that it takes for full voltage repolarization to occur. Thus 
premature  stimulation  immediately  after  the  membrane  potential 
reaches  full  repolarization  leads  to  action  potentials  with  reduced 
amplitudes  and  upstroke  velocities.  Therefore  slow  conduction  and 
prolonged  refractoriness  are  characteristic  features  of  nodal  cells. 
These  cells  also  have  a  reduced  safety  factor  for  conduction  (see 
earlier), which means that the stimulating efficacy of the propagating 
impulse is low and conduction block occurs easily.

Inward  Currents.  Thus  INa  and  ICa.L  represent  two  important 
inward  currents.  Another  important  inward  current  is  If,  also  called 
the pacemaker or funny current.55 This current is activated by hyper-
polarization and is carried by Na+ and K+. It generates phase 4 diastolic 
depolarization in the sinoatrial node. If modulation is one major mech-
anism  whereby  beta-adrenergic  and  cholinergic  neurotransmitters 
regulate cardiac rhythm under physiologic conditions. Catecholamines 
increase the probability of channel opening by shifting the channels 
activation curve to more positive potentials, which leads to increased 
current availability for the generation of diastolic depolarization and 
hence  steepens  its  rate.  Cholinergic  action,  in  general,  exerts  the 
opposite effect.46 Fish oil depresses If.56 The electrophysiologic changes 
accompanying acute myocardial ischemia may represent a depressed 
form of a fast response in the center of the ischemic zone and a slow 
response in the border area. Probable slow-response activity has been 
shown in myocardium resected from patients undergoing surgery for 
recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (see Fig. 33-17F). Whether and 
how slow responses play a role in the genesis of ventricular arrhyth-
mias in these patients have not been established.

Phase  1:  Early  Rapid  Repolarization.  Following  phase  0,  the 
membrane  repolarizes  rapidly  and  transiently  to  almost  0 mV  (early 
notch), partly because of inactivation of INa and concomitant activation 
of several outward currents.

Ito.  The  4-aminopyridinesensitive  transient  outward  K+  current, 
commonly  termed  Ito  (or  Ito1),  is  turned  on  rapidly  by  depolarization 
and then rapidly inactivates. Both the density and recovery of Ito from 
inactivation  exhibit  transmural  gradients  in  the  left  ventricular  free 
wall, with the density decreasing and reactivation becoming progres-
sively  prolonged  from  epicardium  to  endocardium.29  Transmural  dif-
ferences  in  the  expression  of  KChIP2,  the  auxiliary  subunit  to  Kv4.3 
pore-forming alpha subunits, appears to be the primary determinant 
of the transmural gradient in Ito properties and densities in the human 
heart.57 This gradient gives rise to regional differences in action poten-
tial  shape,  with  increasingly  slower  phase  1  restitution  kinetics  and 
diminution of the notch along the transmural axis (Fig. e33-4).

These  regional  differences  might  create  transmural  voltage  gradi-
ents, specifically at higher rates, thereby increasing dispersion of repo-
larization, a putative arrhythmogenic factor (Brugada syndrome; see 
Chapters 32 and 37). However, elimination of the physiologic repo-
larization  gradient  appears  to  be  similarly  arrhythmogenic.57  Down-
regulation of Ito is at least partially responsible for slowing of phase 1 
repolarization in failing human myocytes. Studies have demonstrated 
that these changes in the phase 1 notch of the cardiac action potential 
cause  a  reduction  in  the  kinetics  and  peak  amplitude  of  the  action 
potentialevoked intracellular Ca2+ transient because of failed recruit-
ment and synchronization of SR Ca2+ release through ICa.L (Fig. e33-5). 
Thus modulation of Ito appears to play a significant physiologic role in 
controlling cardiac excitation-contraction coupling,58 and it remains to 
be determined whether transmural differences in phase 1 repolariza-
tion translate into similar differences in regional contractility.

ICl.Ca.  The  4-aminopyridineresistant,  Ca2+-activated 

chloride 
current  ICl.Ca  (or  Ito2)  also  contributes  a  significant  outward  current 
during phase 1 repolarization.59 This current is activated by the action 
potentialevoked intracellular Ca2+ transient. Therefore interventions 
that augment the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient associated with the 
twitch  (such  as  beta-adrenergic  receptor  stimulation)  also  enhance

normal action potential profile having the early phase 1 repolarization notch (left), there was uniform Ca2+ release. However, when a congestive heart failure action potential 
profile without early rapid phase 1 repolarization was used, Ca2+ release was dyssynchronous. This dyssynchrony causes slowing in the rate of rise of the Ca2+ transient and loss 
of spatial and temporal release uniformity. F/F0 = fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator normalized to its baseline fluorescence. (From Harris DM, Mills GD, Chen X, et al: Alterations

TTX-resistant (Nav1.5, Nav1.8) and TTX-sensitive (Nav1.1, Nav1.3, Nav1.6) voltage-gated currents; Nav1.5 is the major 

cardiac isoform; neuronal Na+ channel isoforms contribute to sinoatrial node pacemaking and ventricular repolarization

L-type (long lasting, large conductance) Ca2+ currents through voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels blocked by 

dihydropyridine-type antagonists (e.g., nifedipine), phenylalkylamines (e.g., verapamil), benzothiazepines (e.g., 
diltiazem), and various divalent ions (e.g., Cd2+); activated by dihydropyridine-type agonists (e.g., Bay K 8644); 
responsible for phase 0 depolarization and propagation in sinoatrial and AV nodal tissue and contributing to the plateau 
of atrial, His-Purkinje, and ventricular cells; main trigger of Ca2+ release from the SR (Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release); the 
noninactivating or window component underlies EADs

T-type (transient current, tiny conductance) Ca2+ currents through Cav channels blocked by mibefradil and efonidipine 

but insensitive to dihydropyridines; may contribute an inward current to the later phase of phase 4 depolarization 
in pacemaker cells and action potential propagation in AV nodal cells; role in triggering Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release 
uncertain

Hyperpolarization-activated funny current carried by Na+ and K+ in sinoatrial and AV nodal cells and His-Purkinje cells; 

involved in generating phase 4 depolarization; increases the rate of impulse initiation in pacemaker cells

K+ current through inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels, voltage-dependent block by Ba2+ at micromolar concentrations; 

responsible for maintaining resting the membrane potential in atrial, His-Purkinje, and ventricular cells; channel activity 
is a function of both membrane potential and [K+]o; inward rectification appears to result from depolarization-induced 
internal block by Mg2+ and neutral or positively charged amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic channel pore
Inwardly rectifying K+ current activated by muscarinic (M2) and purinergic (type 1) receptor stimulation via GTP 

regulatory (G) protein signal transduction; expressed in sinoatrial and AV nodal cells and atrial cells, where it causes 
hyperpolarization and action potential shortening; activation causes negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects

K+ current carried by a voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel (delayed rectifier K+ channel); plays a major role in determining phase 

3 of the action potential

Rapidly activating component of delayed rectifier K+ current; IKr specifically blocked by dofetilide and sotalol in a reverse 
usedependent manner; inward rectification of IKr results from depolarization-induced fast inactivation; plays a major 
role in determining the action potential duration

K+ current through a Kv channel with ultrarapid activation but ultraslow inactivation kinetics; expressed in atrial myocytes; 

determines the action potential duration

K+ current through small-conductance Ca2+-activated channels; blocked by apamine and dequalinium chloride; 

expressed in human atrial and ventricular myocytes; determines the action potential duration; upregulated in failing 
cardiomyocytes

Transient outward K+ current through voltage-gated (Kv) channels; exhibits fast activation and inactivation and recovery 
kinetics; blocked by 4-aminopyridine in a reverse usedependent manner; contributes to the time course of phase 1 
repolarization; transmural differences in Ito properties contribute to regional differences in early repolarization

4-Aminopyridineresistant transient outward current carried by Cl ions; activated by an increase in intracellular calcium 

level; blocked by stilbene derivatives (SITS, DIDS); contributes to the time course of phase 1 repolarization; may underlie 
spontaneous transient inward currents under conditions of Ca2+ overload; molecular correlate uncertain

Time-independent chloride current regulated by the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway; slightly depolarizes resting 

membrane potential and significantly shortens the action potential duration; antagonizes action potential prolongation 
associated with beta-adrenergic stimulation of ICa.L

Na+ inward and Ca2+ outward current (3 Na+ for 1 Ca2+); direction of Na+ flux depends on membrane potential and

outward ICl.Ca. It is not currently known whether human cardiac myo-
cytes  express  Ca2+-activated  chloride  channels.  Other, 
time-
independent chloride currents may also play a role in determining the 
time  course  of  early  repolarization,  such  as  the  cAMP-  or  swelling-
activated chloride conductances ICl.cAMP and ICl.swell.

Na/Ca Exchanger.  A third current contributing to early repolariza-
tion is Na+ outward movement through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger oper-
ating  in  reverse  mode  (see  Fig.  33-16).60  Overexpression  of  the 
exchanger in transgenic mice caused accentuation of the early notch 
in left ventricular myocytes.

Sometimes,  a  transient  depolarization  follows  phase  1  repolariza-
tion. This notch is well defined and separated from phase 2 in Purkinje 
fibers and left ventricular epicardial and midmyocardial myocytes (see 
Fig. e33-4).

Phase  2:  Plateau.  During  the  plateau  phase,  which  may  last 
several hundred milliseconds, membrane conductance of all ions falls 
to  rather  low  values.  Thus  less  change  in  current  is  required  near 
plateau levels than near resting potential levels to produce the same 
changes  in  transmembrane  potential.  The  plateau  is  maintained  by 
competition between the outward current carried by K+ and Cl ions 
and the inward current carried by Ca2+ moving through open L-type 
Ca2+ channels and Na+ being exchanged for internal Ca2+ by the Na+/
Ca2+  exchanger  operating  in  forward  mode.  After  depolarization, 
potassium  conductance  falls  to  plateau  levels  as  a  result  of  inward 
rectification despite the large electrochemical driving force on K+ ions.
Rectification  simply  means  that  membrane  conductance  changes 
with voltage. Specifically, inward rectification means that K+ channels 
are open at negative potentials but closed at less negative or positive 
voltages.  Membrane  depolarizationinduced  internal  block  by  intra-
cellular ionized magnesium is thought to underlie inward rectification 
of  cardiac  IKl  channels.  Inward  rectification  can  also  be  induced  by 
neutral and positively charged amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic 
channel pore that is formed by four Kir2.1 subunits.61 The mechanism 
underlying rectification of the rapid component of the delayed recti-
fier  K+  current  (IKr)  in  cardiac  cells  is  the  inactivation  that  channels 
rapidly  undergo  during  depolarizing  pulses.  More  IKr  channels  enter 
the  inactivated  state  with  stronger  depolarizations,  thereby  causing 
inward  rectification.  This  fast  inactivation  mechanism  is  sensitive  to 
changes in extracellular K+ in the physiologic range, with inactivation 
being more accentuated at low extracellular K+ concentrations. Thus 
hypokalemia  would  decrease  outward  IKr,  thereby  prolonging  the 
action potential duration.

Outward  K+  movement  carried  by  the  slow  component  of  the 
delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) also contributes to plateau duration: 
(1) IKs density has been shown to be correlated with the action poten-
tial duration, and (2) isolated defects in the KvLQT1 subunit, which in 
combination  with  the  IKs  subunit  (minK)  reconstitutes  the  cardiac  IKs 
current,  are  associated  with  abnormally  prolonged  ventricular  repo-
larization  (LQTS  type  1;  see  Chapters  32  and  37).  Although  IKs 
activates  slowly  in  comparison  to  the  action  potential  duration,  it  is 
only  slowly  inactivated.  Therefore  increases  in  heart  rate  can  cause 
this  activation  to  accumulate  during  successive  depolarizations,  and 
cumulative activation can determine the contribution to repolarization 
of K+ currents that are active during the plateau of the action poten-
tial.  In  conditions  of  reduced  intracellular  ATP  concentration  (e.g., 
hypoxia,  ischemia),  K+  efflux  through  activated  KATP  channels  is 
enhanced, thereby shortening the plateau phase of the action poten-
tial. Other ionic mechanisms that control plateau potential and dura-
tion  include  the  kinetics  of  inactivation  of  the  L-type  Ca2+  current. 
Reduced efficiency of intracellular free Ca2+ in inducing Ca2+-depen-
dent inactivation, such as in myocytes from hypertrophic hearts, can 
result in delayed repolarization. Steady-state components of both INa 
and  ICa.L  (window  currents)  also  shape  the  plateau  phase.33  Na+,K+-
ATPase  generates  a  net  outward  current  by  pumping  out  three  Na+ 
ions in exchange for two K+ ions. Noninactivating chloride currents, 
such  as  ICl.swell  and  ICl.cAMP,  may  produce  significant  outward  currents 
during  the  plateau  phase  under  certain  conditions,  thereby  signifi-
cantly  shortening  the  action  potential  duration.  A  nonselective, 
swelling-induced cation current has been shown to cause prolonga-
tion fo action potentials in myocytes from failing ventricles.

Phase 3: Final Rapid Repolarization.  In this portion of the action 
potential, repolarization proceeds rapidly at least in part because of 
two currents: time-dependent inactivation of ICa.L, with a decrease in 
the intracellular movement of positive charges, and activation of repo-
larizing K+ currents, including the slow and rapid components of the 
delayed rectifier K+ currents IKs and IKr and the inwardly rectifying K+ 
currents IKl and IK.Ach, which all cause an increase in the movement of 
positive charges out of the cell. The net membrane current becomes 

more  outward,  and  the  membrane  potential  shifts  to  the  resting 
potential.  A  small-conductance  Ca2+-activated  K+  current,  IK.Ca,  is 
expressed in human atrial myocytes, where it controls the time course 
of phase 3 repolarization.62 Loss-of-function mutations in the human 
ether-a-go-gorelated  gene  (HERG),  which  is  responsible  for  IKr, 
prolong phase 3 repolarization, thereby predisposing to the develop-
ment of torsades de pointes. Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromy-
cin, antihistamines such as terfenadine, and antifungal drugs such as 
ketoconazole inhibit IKr and have been implicated in the acquired form 
of LQTS (see Chapters 32 and 39). A decrease in IKl activity, as is the 
case in left ventricular myocytes from failing hearts, causes prolonga-
tion of the action potential by slowing of phase 3 repolarization and 
resting membrane depolarization. A reduction in the outward potas-
sium current through open inwardly rectifying K+ channels renders the 
failing  cardiomyocyte  more  susceptible  to  the  induction  of  DADs   
triggered by spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ release events and there-
fore plays a major role in arrhythmogenesis in the failing heart (see  
Fig. 33-20).

Phase 4: Diastolic Depolarization.  Under normal conditions the 
membrane  potential  of  atrial  and  ventricular  muscle  cells  remains 
steady throughout diastole. IKl is the current responsible for maintain-
ing  the  resting  potential  near  the  K+  equilibrium  potential  in  atrial, 
His-Purkinje, and ventricular cells. IKl is the inward rectifier and shuts 
off during depolarization. In other fibers found in certain parts of the 
atria, in the muscle of the mitral and tricuspid valves, in His-Purkinje 
fibers, and in the sinoatrial node and portions of the AV nodal tract, 
the resting membrane potential does not remain constant in diastole 
but  gradually  depolarizes  (see  Figs.  33-4,  33-7,  and  33-17A).  The 
property possessed by spontaneously discharging cells is called phase 
4 diastolic depolarization; when it leads to initiation of action poten-
tials,  automaticity  results.  The  discharge  rate  of  the  sinoatrial  node 
normally  exceeds  the  discharge  rate  of  other  potentially  automatic 
pacemaker sites and thus maintains dominance of the cardiac rhythm. 
The discharge rate of the sinoatrial node is usually more sensitive than 
the discharge rate of ventricular muscle cells to the effects of norepi-
nephrine and acetylcholine. Normal or abnormal automaticity at other 
sites  can  cause  discharge  at  rates  faster  than  the  sinoatrial  nodal 
discharge rate and can thus usurp control of the cardiac rhythm for 
one cycle or many (see Chapter 34).

Normal Automaticity
Two  models  of  sinoatrial  node  pacemaking  have  been  proposed.  In 
the first model, HCN channels are activated by hyperpolarizations in 
the normal range of diastolic membrane potentials. During the hyper-
polarized  diastolic  membrane  potential  between  consecutive  action 
potentials, HCN channels will increase their probability of being open 
(see  earlier).  Open  HCN  channels  conduct  both  Na+  and  K+,  but  at 
these negative membrane potentials they let mainly Na+ into the cells. 
It  is  this  inward  Na+  current  through  HCN  channels  (together  with 
inflow  of  Ca2+  through  voltage-activated  Ca2+  channels,  inward  cur-
rents  through  Na+/Ca2+  exchangers,  and  decaying  outward  K+  cur-
rents; see Fig. 33-16) at diastolic membrane potentials that is thought 
to  depolarize  the  pacemaker  cells  to  threshold  and  thus  trigger  the 
next action potential and generate a periodically firing pacemaker (see 
Fig. 33-17A).63

In the model proposed by proponents of Ca2+ oscillations operating 
as  the  primary  pacemaking  mechanism  (Ca2+  clock),  periodic 
increases in [Ca2+]i serve as an internal generator (calcium clock) of 
rhythmic  signals  that  are  transformed  into  changes  in  membrane 
voltage  via  modulation  of  calcium-sensitive  ion  channels  and  trans-
porters  in  the  outer  membrane  (membrane  clock).64  This  novel 
concept  is  illustrated  in  Figure  33-18,  in  which  simultaneous  [Ca2+]i 
and action potential measurements in isolated sinoatrial myocytes are 
used as an example. Local submembrane increases in [Ca2+]i (denoted 
by the white arrows in Fig. 33-18B, C) occurring during the later part 
of  the  spontaneous  diastolic  depolarization  (transmembrane  action 
potentials are shown in blue) precede the rapid upstroke of the action 
potential. These local submembrane increases in [Ca2+]i are abolished 
by a specific blocker of the SR Ca2+ release channel, ryanodine (Ryan), 
concurrent with slowing of the beating frequency by this drug. The 
periodic  SR  Ca2+  release  events  rhythmically  activate  the  Na+/Ca2+ 
exchange inward (i.e., depolarizing) current (INCX; Fig. 33-18D), which 
then  results  in  an  exponential  increase  in  membrane  potential  that 
prompts activation of surface membrane L-type Ca2+ channels to initi-
ate an action potential (see Fig. 33-18D). Thus the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 
operating in forward mode plays an essential role in converting the 
primary intracellular Ca2+ signals into membrane (i.e., voltage) signals. 
In  this  novel  model  of  sinoatrial  node  pacemaking,  spontaneous  SR

Ca2+  releaseinduced  membrane  excitation  initiates  the  sinoatrial 
node  cell  duty  cycle,  as  schematically  illustrated  in  Figure  33-18D. 
Once  an  action  potential  has  been  initiated,  two  highly  interacting, 
concurrent series of events proceed during a normal sinoatrial node 
cell cycle (see Fig. 33-18D). In one event series (delimited to the outer 
membrane), depolarization-induced activation of the delayed rectifier 
K+  current  IK  (see  Table  33-3)  leads  to  membrane  hyperpolarization, 
which is followed by slow diastolic depolarization via activation of a 
number of inward currents, including If and ICa.T (see Table 33-3). In a

second,  parallel  cycle  of  events,  action  potentialinduced  SR  Ca2+ 
release is followed by Ca2+ reuptake into the SR, which subsequently 
gives rise to multifocal, synchronized spontaneous Ca2+ release events 
culminating  in  an  increase  in  inward  INCX.  The  role  of  late  diastolic 
spontaneous SR Ca2+ release events in triggering the sinoatrial node 
action potential has recently been confirmed in canine hearts in situ 
(Fig. e33-6).65

The  rate  of  sinoatrial  nodal  discharge  can  be  varied  by  several 
mechanisms in response to autonomic or other influences. The pace-
maker  locus  can  shift  within  or  outside  the  sinoatrial  node  to  cells 
discharging faster or more slowly.63 If the pacemaker site remains the 
same, alterations in the slope of the diastolic depolarization, maximum 
diastolic potential, or threshold potential can speed or slow the dis-
charge rate (Fig. 33-18A). For example, if the slope of diastolic depo-
larization  steepens  and  if  the  resting  membrane  potential  becomes 
less negative or the threshold potential more negative (within limits), 
the  discharge  rate  increases.  Opposite  changes  slow  the  discharge 
rate. The molecular mechanism that is primarily responsible for accel-
eration of the sinoatrial node discharge rate has been highly contro-
versial. Proponents of the HCN pacemaker role consider an increase 
in inward HCN current via a shift of the HCN channel activation curve 
to more depolarized potentials the primary regulatory mechanism.3,65 
In  contrast,  proponents  of  the  Ca2+  clock  model  have  suggested 
protein kinase Amediated phosphorylation of Ca2+-handling proteins 
(ryanodine  receptor,  phospholamban  [see  Chapter  21],  SERCA, 
voltage-gated  Ca2+  channels)  as  the  mechanism  responsible  for 
increased action potential firing: an increase in the level of cAMP (after 
beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation) augments the activity of protein 
kinase A, which then increases the rate of spontaneous SR Ca2+ release 
and  SR  Ca2+  reuptake  via  synergistic  activation  of  these  proteins, 
whereas a reduction in cAMP levels (after muscarinic receptor stimula-
tion) has the opposite effect.1 Acetylcholine activates K+ efflux through 
inward  rectifier  K+  channels,  which  are 
acetylcholine-sensitive 
expressed in both sinoatrial nodal and AV nodal cells, thereby shifting 
the maximum diastolic potential to more negative values. The same 
mechanism  reduces  input  resistance  at  diastolic  potentials,  which 
means  that  a  greater  depolarizing  current  would  be  required  to 
achieve the threshold for firing an action potential.

Passive  Membrane  Electrical  Properties.  Passive  membrane 
properties,  including  membrane  resistance,  capacitance,  and  cable 
properties,  play  an  important  role  in  cardiac  electrophysiology. 
Although the cardiac cell membrane is resistant to current flow, it also 
has capacitive properties, which means that it behaves like a battery 
and can store charges of opposite signs on its two sidesan excess 
of  negative  charges  inside  the  membrane  balanced  by  equivalent 
positive charges outside the membrane. These resistive and capacitive 
properties cause the membrane to take a certain amount of time to 
respond  to  an  applied  stimulus,  rather  than  responding  instantly, 
because the charges across the capacitive membrane must be altered 
first.  A  subthreshold  rectangular  current  pulse  applied  to  the  mem-
brane  produces  a  slowly  rising  and  decaying  change  in  membrane 
voltage rather than a rectangular voltage change. A value called the 
time  constant  of  the  membrane  reflects  this  property.  The  time

This is the time taken by the membrane voltage to reach 63% of 
its final value after application of a steady current. The time course of 
changes  in  membrane  potential  after  the  application  of  a  hyper-
polarizing or depolarizing subthreshold current step is typically mono-
exponential  in  all  myocyte  types,  thus  indicating  that  the  entire 
sarcolemma  (including  the  T-tubular  membrane;  see  Fig.  e33-1)  is 
charging uniformly.

When aligned end to end, cardiac cells, particularly the His-Purkinje 
system, behave like a long cable in which current flows more easily 
inside the cell and to the adjacent cell across the gap junction than it 
does across the cell membrane to the outside. When current is injected 
at a point, most of it flows along inside the cell, but some leaks out. 
Because of this loss of current, the change in voltage of a cell at a site 
distant  from  the  point  of  applied  current  is  less  than  the  change  in 
membrane  voltage  at  the  point  where  the  stimulus  was  applied.  A 
measure of this property of a cable is called the space or length con-
stant lambda (), which is the distance along the cable from the point 
of stimulation at which the voltage at steady state is 1/e (37%) of its 
value at the point of introduction.

Restated,  describes how far current flows before leaking passively 
across  the  surface  membrane  to  a  value  about  a  third  of  its  initial 
value.  This  distance  is  normally  approximately  2 mm  for  Purkinje 
fibers,  0.5 mm  for  the  sinoatrial  node,  and  0.8 mm  for  ventricular 
muscle fibers.  is about 10 times the length of an individual cell. As 
an  example,  if  e  is  approximately  2.7  and  a  hyperpolarizing  current 
pulse in a Purkinje fiber produces a change in membrane voltage of 
15 mV at the site of current injection, the change in membrane poten-
tial one space constant (2 mm) away would be 15/2.7 = 5.5 mV.

Because  the  current  loop  in  any  circuit  must  be  closed,  current 
must flow back to its point of origin. Local circuit currents pass across 
gap  junctions  between  cells  and  exit  across  the  sarcolemmal  mem-
brane  to  close  the  loop  and  complete  the  circuit.  Inward  excitation 
currents  in  one  area  (carried  by  Na+  in  most  regions)  flow  intracel-
lularly  along  the  length  of  the  tissue  (carried  mostly  by  K+),  escape 
across the membrane, and flow extracellularly in a longitudinal direc-
tion.  The  outside  local  circuit  current  is  the  current  recorded  on  an 
electrocardiogram.  Through  these  local  circuit  currents  the  trans-
membrane  potential  of  each  cell  influences  the  transmembrane 
potential of its neighbor because of the passive flow of current from 
one  segment  of  the  fiber  to  another  across  the  low-resistance  gap 
junctions.

As  discussed  earlier,  the  speed  of  conduction  depends  on  active 
membrane  properties  such  as  the  magnitude  of  the  Na+  current,  a 
measure of which is  (cid:31)Vmax. Passive membrane properties also contrib-
ute to conduction velocity and include the excitability threshold, which 
influences  the  capability  of  cells  adjacent  to  the  one  that  has  been 
discharged to reach threshold; the intracellular resistance of the cell, 
determined by free ions in the cytoplasm; the resistance of the gap 
junction;  and  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  cell.  The  direction  of 
propagation is crucial because of the influence of anisotropy, as men-
tioned earlier.

Loss of Membrane Potential and Development of Arrhythmia. 
Many  acquired  abnormalities  of  cardiac  muscle  or  specialized  fibers 
that result in arrhythmias produce a loss of membrane potential; that 
is,  maximum  diastolic  potential  becomes  less  negative.  This  change 
should be viewed as a symptom of an underlying abnormality, analo-
gous to fever or jaundice, rather than as a diagnostic category in and 
of itself because both the ionic changes resulting in cellular depolar-
ization  and  the  more  fundamental  biochemical  or  metabolic  abnor-
malities responsible for the ionic alterations probably have a number 
of causative factors.

Cellular depolarization can result from elevated [K+]o or decreased 
[K+]i, an increase in membrane permeability to Na+ (PNa increases), or 
a decrease in membrane permeability to K+ (PK decreases). Reference 
to the GHK equation for V (see Phases of the Cardiac Action Potential: 
General  Considerations)  illustrates  that  these  changes  alone  or  in 
combination make membrane diastolic voltage less negative.

Normal cells perfused by an abnormal milieu (e.g., hyperkalemia), 
abnormal  cells  perfused  by  a  normal  milieu  (e.g.,  healed  myocardial 
infarction),  or  abnormal  cells  perfused  by  an  abnormal  milieu  (e.g., 
acute myocardial ischemia and infarction) can exist alone or in com-
bination  and  reduce  resting  membrane  voltage.  Each  of  these 
changes can have one or more biochemical or metabolic causes. For 

example,  acute  myocardial  ischemia  results  in  decreased  [K+]i  and 
increased  [K+]o,  release  of  norepinephrine,  and  acidosis,  which  may 
be related to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+-induced tran-
sient inward currents and accumulation of amphipathic lipid metabo-
lites and oxygen free radicals. All these changes can contribute to the 
development  of  an  abnormal  electrophysiologic  environment  and 
arrhythmias  during  ischemia  and  reperfusion.  Knowledge  of  these 
changes may provide insight into therapy that actually reverses basic 
defects  and  restores  membrane  potential  or  other  abnormalities  to 
normal.

Effects  of  Reduced  Resting  Potential.  The  reduced  resting 
membrane  potential  alters  the  depolarization  and  repolarization 
phases of the cardiac action potential. For example, partial membrane 
depolarization causes a decrease in the steady-state availability of fast 
sodium channels, thereby reducing the magnitude of peak INa during 
phase 0 of the action potential. The subsequent reduction in  (cid:31)Vmax  
and action potential amplitude prolongs the conduction time of the 
propagated impulse, at times to the point of block.28

Action  potentials  with  reduced  upstroke  velocity  resulting  from 
partial inactivation of INa are called depressed fast responses (see Fig. 
33-17F). Their contours often resemble and can be difficult to distin-
guish from slow responses, in which upstrokes are caused by ICa.L (see 
Fig. 33-17F). Membrane depolarization to levels of 60 to 70 mV can 
inactivate  a  substantial  portion  of  the  available  voltage-gated  Na+ 
channels, and depolarization to 50 mV or less can almost completely 
inactivate all the Na+ channels (see Fig. 33-12). At membrane poten-
tials positive to 50 mV, ICa.L can be activated to generate phase 0 if 
conditions are appropriate. These changes in action potential are likely 
to be heterogeneous, with unequal degrees of Na+ inactivation that 
create areas with minimally reduced velocity, more severely depressed 
zones, and areas of complete block. These uneven changes are con-
ducive to the development of arrhythmias.

In these cells with reduced membrane potential, refractoriness can 
outlast voltage recovery of the action potential; that is, the cell can 
still  be  refractory  or  partially  refractory  after  the  resting  membrane 
potential returns to its most negative value. Furthermore, if cardiac-
impulse  block  occurs  in  a  fairly  localized  area  without  significant 
slowing of conduction proximal to the site of block, cells in this proxi-
mal zone exhibit short action potentials and refractory periods because 
unexcited cells distal to the block (still in a polarized state) electrotoni-
cally speed recovery in cells proximal to the site of block.

If  conduction  slows  gradually  proximal  to  the  site  of  block,  the 
duration of these action potentials and their refractory periods can be 
prolonged. Some cells can exhibit abnormal electrophysiologic prop-
erties, even though they have a relatively normal resting membrane 
potential.

MECHANISMSOFARRHYTHMOGENESIS

The mechanisms responsible for cardiac arrhythmias (Table 33-4) 
are generally divided into categories of disorders of impulse forma-
tion,  disorders  of  impulse  conduction,  or  combinations  of  both. 
However,  our  currently  available  diagnostic  tools  do  not  permit 
unequivocal  determination  of  the  electrophysiologic  mechanisms 
responsible for many clinically occurring arrhythmias or their ionic 
bases. This is especially true for ventricular arrhythmias. It may be 
clinically  difficult  to  separate  microanatomic  reentry  from  automa-
ticity,  and  often  one  is  left  with  the  consideration  that  a  particular 
arrhythmia is most consistent with or best explained by one or 
the  other  electrophysiologic  mechanism.  Some  tachyarrhythmias 
can be started by one mechanism and be perpetuated by another. 
An  episode  of  tachycardia  caused  by  one  mechanism  can  precipi-
tate  another  episode  caused  by  a  different  mechanism.  For 
example, an initiating tachycardia or premature complex caused by 
abnormal  automaticity  can  precipitate  an  episode  of  tachycardia 
sustained  by  reentry.  However,  by  use  of  the  features  of  entrain-
ment  (see  later),  arrhythmias  caused  by  macroreentry  circuits  can 
be identified.

charge rate of the normal pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (e.g., sinus

rates too fast or too slow for the physiologic needs of the patient), or 
discharge of an ectopic pacemaker that controls atrial or ventricular 
rhythm. Pacemaker discharge from ectopic sites, often called latent 
or subsidiary pacemakers, can occur in fibers located in several parts 
of the atria, coronary sinus and pulmonary veins, AV valves, portions 
of  the  AV  junction,  and  His-Purkinje  system.  Ordinarily  kept  from 
reaching  the  level  of  threshold  potential  because  of  overdrive  sup-
pression by the more rapidly firing sinus node or electrotonic depres-
sion  from  contiguous  fibers,  ectopic  pacemaker  activity  at  one  of 
these latent sites can become manifested when the sinus nodal dis-
charge rate slows or block occurs at some level between the sinoatrial 
node  and  the  ectopic  pacemaker  site,  which  permits  escape  of  the 
latent  pacemaker  at  the  latters  normal  discharge  rate.  A  clinical 
example would be sinus bradycardia to a rate of 45 beats/min that 
permits  an  AV  junctional  escape  complex  to  occur  at  a  rate  of  50 
beats/min.

Alternatively, the discharge rate of the latent pacemaker can speed 
inappropriately and usurp control of cardiac rhythm from the sino-
atrial  node,  which  has  been  discharging  at  a  normal  rate,  such  as 
occurs  with  a  premature  ventricular  complex  (PVC)  or  a  burst  of 
ventricular tachycardia. Such disorders of impulse formation can be 
caused by speeding or slowing of a normal pacemaker mechanism 
(e.g., phase 4 diastolic depolarization that is ionically normal for the 
sinoatrial  node  or  for  an  ectopic  site  such  as  a  Purkinje  fiber  but 
occurs inappropriately fast or slow) or by an ionically abnormal pace-
maker mechanism.

A patient with persistent sinus tachycardia at rest or sinus brady-
cardia during exertion exhibits inappropriate sinus nodal discharge 
rates, but the ionic mechanisms responsible for sinus nodal discharge 
can  still  be  normal,  although  the  kinetics  or  magnitude  of  the  
currents can be altered. Conversely, when a patient experiences ven-
tricular tachycardia during acute myocardial infarction, ionic mecha-
nisms  ordinarily  not  involved  in  the  formation  of  spontaneous 
impulses for this fiber type can be operative and generate the tachy-
cardia.  For  example,  although  pacemaker  activity  is  not  generally 
found  in  ordinary  working  myocardium,  the  effects  of  myocardial 
infarction can perhaps depolarize these cells to membrane potentials 

at  which  inactivation  of  IK  and  activation  of  ICa.L  cause  automatic 
discharge. In vitro studies have demonstrated that myofibroblasts in 
infarct  scars  depolarize  cardiomyocytes  by  heterocellular  electro-
tonic  interactions  via  gap  junctions  and  also  induce  synchronized 
spontaneous activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes.66

Abnormal Automaticity.  The mechanisms responsible for normal 
automaticity were described earlier. Abnormal automaticity can arise 
from  cells  that  have  reduced  maximum  diastolic  potentials,  often   
at membrane potentials positive to 50 mV, when IK and ICa.L may be 
operative.

Automaticity at membrane potentials more negative than 70 mV 
may be caused by If. When the membrane potential is between 50 
and 70 mV, the cell may be quiescent. Electrotonic effects from sur-
rounding normally polarized or more depolarized myocardium influ-
ence the development of automaticity.64 Abnormal automaticity has 
been found in Purkinje fibers removed from dogs subjected to myo-
cardial  infarction,  in  rat  myocardium  damaged  by  epinephrine,  in 
human atrial samples, and in ventricular myocardial specimens from 
patients  undergoing  aneurysmectomy  and  endocardial  resection  for 
recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Abnormal automaticity can be produced in normal muscle or Pur-
kinje fibers by appropriate interventions, such as passage of current 
that reduces diastolic potential. An automatic discharge rate speeds 
up  with  progressive  depolarization,  and  hyperpolarizing  pulses  slow 
the  spontaneous  firing.  It  is  possible  that  partial  depolarization  and 
failure to reach normal maximal diastolic potential can induce auto-
matic discharge in most if not all cardiac fibers. Although this type of 
spontaneous automatic activity has been found in human atrial and 
ventricular fibers, its relationship to the genesis of clinical arrhythmias 
has not been established. Abnormal automaticity in Purkinje cells can 
also  originate  secondary  to  spontaneous,  submembrane  Ca2+  eleva-
tions  via  activation  of  calcium-sensitive  membrane  conductances,  a 
process identical to that previously identified in sinoatrial nodal myo-
cytes. Indeed, Purkinje myocytes isolated from mice heterozygous for 
an  arrhythmia-causing  mutation  in  the  gene  encoding  the  cardiac 
ryanodine  receptor  Ca2+  release  channel  (RyR2)  display  a  greater 
propensity  for  the  development  of  arrhythmogenic  Ca2+-handling 
abnormalities than do mutant ventricular cardiomyocytes.67 This pro-
arrhythmic  behavior  is  further  exacerbated  by  catecholaminergic

stimulation with the development of triggered beats (Fig. e33-7), thus 
supporting the concept that Purkinje cells are critical contributors to 
arrhythmic  triggers  in  animal  models  and  humans  with  RyR2  muta-
tions  that  are  linked  to  CPVT.  The  occurrence  of  such  spontaneous 
localized [Ca2+]i transients has been confirmed in canine Purkinje cells 
(see Video 33-2).68

Rhythms resulting from automaticity may be slow atrial, junctional, 
and ventricular escape rhythms; certain types of atrial tachycardias 
(e.g., those produced by digitalis or perhaps those coming from pul-
monary  veins);  accelerated  junctional  (nonparoxysmal  junctional 
tachycardia)  and  idioventricular  rhythms;  and  parasystole  (see 
Chapter 37).

Triggered Activity
Automaticity is the property of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontane-
ously, without need for prior stimulation, so that electrical quiescence 
does not occur. Triggered activity is initiated by afterdepolarizations, 
which are depolarizing oscillations in membrane voltage induced by 
one  or  more  preceding  action  potentials.  Thus  triggered  activity  is 
pacemaker  activity  that  results  as  a  consequence  of  a  preceding 
impulse  or  series  of  impulses,  without  which  electrical  quiescence 
occurs (Fig. 33-19). This triggering activity is not caused by an auto-
matic self-generating mechanism, and the term triggered automaticity 
is  therefore  contradictory.  These  depolarizations  can  occur  before  
or  after  full  repolarization  of  the  fiber  and  are  best  termed  EADs  
when they arise from a reduced level of membrane potential during 
phases 2 (type 1) and 3 (type 2) of the cardiac action potential (see 

Fig.  e33-12)  or  late  afterdepolarizations  or  DADs  (see 
Fig. 33-19) when they occur after completion of repolar-
ization  (phase  4),  generally  at  a  more  negative  mem-
brane potential than that from which EADs arise. Not all 
afterdepolarizations may reach threshold potential, but 
if  they  do,  they  can  trigger  another  afterdepolarization 
and thus self-perpetuate.

Delayed  Afterdepolarizations.  DADs  and  triggered 
activity have been demonstrated in Purkinje fibers, special-
ized atrial fibers and ventricular muscle fibers exposed to 
digitalis  preparations,  pulmonary  veins,  normal  Purkinje 
fibers exposed to Na-free superfusates from the endocar-
dium of the intact heart, ventricular myocardial cells from 
failing  hearts  (Fig.  33-20)  and  from  mouse  hearts  with 
ankyrin-B  mutations 
(see  Fig.  33-19)  during  beta-
adrenergic  stimulation,  and  endocardial  preparations  1 
day  after  a  myocardial  infarction.69,70  When  fibers  in  the 
rabbit, canine, simian, and human mitral valves and in the 
canine  tricuspid  valve  and  coronary  sinus  are  superfused 
with  norepinephrine,  they  exhibit  the  capability  for  sus-
tained triggered rhythmic activity.

Triggered activity caused by DADs has also been noted 
in diseased human atrial and ventricular fibers studied in 
vitro. Left stellate ganglion stimulation can elicit DADs in 
canine ventricles. In vivo, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias 
apparently caused by triggered activity have been reported 
in the dog and possibly in humans. It is tempting to ascribe 
certain clinical arrhythmias to DADs, such as some arrhyth-
mias precipitated by digitalis or some cases of AF arising 
from  DADs  in  pulmonary  veins.  The  accelerated  idioven-
tricular rhythm 1 day after experimental canine myocardial 
infarction may be caused by DADs, and some evidence has 
suggested  that  certain  ventricular  tachycardias,  such  as 
those arising in the right ventricular outflow tract, may be 
caused  by  DADs,  whereas  other  data  suggest  that  EADs 
are responsible.71

Major  Role  of  Intracellular  Ca2+-Handling  Abnor-
malities in the Generation of Delayed Afterdepolar-
izations.  It is well recognized that DADs result from the 
activation of a calcium-sensitive inward current elicited by 
spontaneous increases in the intracellular free calcium con-
centration. Acquired or inherited abnormalities in the prop-
erties of the SR calcium release channels or SR calcium-binding 
proteins underlie these spontaneous calcium release events.
Rapid mobilization of Ca2+ from the SR into the cytosol is mediated 
by the synchronous opening of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release chan-
nels (ryanodine receptors, RyRs). The cardiac RyR is composed of four 
equivalent subunits (homotetramer), each encoded by the RYR2 gene. 
During cardiac systole, the small influx of calcium ions through L-type 
Cav channels triggers a massive release of Ca2+ from the SR via syn-
chronous  opening  of  RyR2  channels,  a  process  called  Ca2+-induced 
Ca2+ release (see Chapter 21). During diastole, RyR2 channels close 
and Ca2+ is recycled into the SR via calcium pumps, thereby refilling 
SR Ca2+ stores for the next release cycle. The duration and amplitude 
of Ca2+ efflux from the SR are therefore tightly controlled by the gating 
of RyR2 channels. RyR2 interacts with a number of accessory proteins 
to  form  a  macromolecular  Ca2+  release  complex  (see  Fig.  e33-6). 
Proteins  interact  with  RyR2  at  multiple  sites  within  the  cytosolic 
domains of RyR2 (e.g., protein phosphatases) or at the SR level (e.g., 
calsequestrin,  the  major  calcium-binding  protein  in  the  SR  lumen). 
Among the cytosolic ligands, FKBP-12.6 (calstabin 2) has been impli-
cated  in  stabilizing  the  closed  state  of  the  RyR2  channel  and  thus 
preventing diastolic Ca2+ leakage (Fig. e33-8).72

Mutations in the human RYR2 gene and in the gene CASQ2, which 
encodes  calsequestrin  (see  Fig.  e33-6),  have  been  linked  to  CPVT. 
Experimental studies have revealed that the RYR2 and CASQ2 muta-
tions  that  underlie  CPVT  cause  an  increase  in  the  sensitivity  of  the 
RyR2  channel  to  luminal  Ca2+  activation  on  adrenergic  stimulation 
(e.g., from emotional or physical stress) and enhance the propensity 
for  spontaneous,  diastolic  Ca2+  release  from  the  SR  and  subsequent 
DAD-triggered  arrhythmias  (see  later).27,73-75  It  is  also  possible 
that CPVT mutants exhibit reduced affinity for binding of the regula-
tory protein FKBP-12.6, thereby resulting in diastolic Ca2+ leakage from 
the  SR.76  Reduced  FKBP-12.6  binding  caused  by  protein  kinase  A
mediated  hyperphosphorylation  has  been  implicated  in  cardiac 
failure.77  Polymorphic

(triggered action potential, TA). Note that the action potential upstroke is preceded 
by a low-amplitude elevation in Ca2+, followed by a suprathreshold membrane depo-
larization that triggers a markedly prolonged action potential. (From Kang G, Giovan-
none SF, Liu N, et al: Purkinje cells from RyR2 mutant mice are highly arrhythmogenic 
but responsive to targeted therapy. Circ Res 107:512, 2010.)

and Holter recording of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) seen in a failing heart. B, Spontaneous aftercontractions and increases in [Ca2+]i in a failing cardiomyocyte after 
exposure to isoproterenol. C, Induction of a DAD by the application of caffeine (cDAD) in a cardiomyocyte isolated from a failing rabbit heart. In normal Tyrode (NT) solution, 
caffeine causes rapid release of Ca2+ from the SR, thereby leading to increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration (bottom tracing), which in turn causes membrane 
depolarization. Blocking of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current in Na+-free and Ca2+-free solution (0Na/0Ca) abolished DADs despite a similar increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas blocking of 
the Ca2+-activated Cl current with niflumate did not prevent DADs. Em = membrane voltage. (From Pogwizd SM, Schlotthauer K, Li L, et al: Arrhythmogenesis and contractile

ventricular  tachycardia  develops  in  FKBP-12.6deficient  mice  on 
adrenergic  stimulation.78  Treatment  with  the  1,4-benzothiazepine 
derivatives  JTV519  and  S107,  which  restore  FKBP-12.6  affinity  for 
RyR2, has been shown to suppress catecholamine-induced polymor-
phic ventricular tachycardia in FKBP-12.6deficient mice.27,79

The IP3 receptor (IP3R) is another Ca2+ release channel in cardiomyo-
cytes  that  is  activated  by  binding  of  the  second  messenger  IP3  and 
cytosolic Ca2+. IP3R exists as a homotetramer or heterotetramer, each 
encoded by the ITPR1, ITPR2, or ITPR3 gene (Fig. e33-9 ). The type 2 
IP3R  is  the  predominant  subtype  in  atrial  myocytes,  where  they  are 
located near RyR2 channels at the SR Ca2+ release sites and contribute 
to  altered  excitation-contraction  coupling  and  arrhythmogenesis  in 
the atria.80 In Purkinje myocytes, type 1 IP3Rs colocalize with type 3 
RyR in the subsarcolemmal space to form a functional dyad that criti-
cally determines electrical excitability.68,81 IP3-dependent Ca2+ signaling 
has  been  implicated  in  cardiac  arrhythmias  attributable  to  ischemia 
and  reperfusion  injury,  inflammatory  processes,  and  developing 
cardiac  failure.82  IP3Rs  are  upregulated  in  heart  failure  and  AF.83  In 
atrial and Purkinje myocytes, IP3 causes spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients, 
Ca2+  waves,  and  Ca2+  alternans  and  facilitates  the  generation  of 
afterdepolarizations.82

The cascade of events linking cellular Ca2+-handling abnormalities 
to  cardiac  arrhythmias  is  illustrated  in  Figure  33-21.  Ca2+  leaking 
through SR Ca2+ release channels during diastole gives rise to localized 
increases in the cytosolic calcium level in a single cardiomyocyte. The 

focally elevated Ca2+ then causes a propagating Ca2+ wave that depo-
larizes the cardiomyocyte membrane and triggers a DAD via transient 
activation of the inward Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (INa/Ca).52 Inhibition 
of calmodulin kinase eliminates transient inward INa/Ca in isolated rabbit 
ventricular  myocytes,  thus  indicating  that  activation  of  this  enzyme 
plays  an  important  role  in  cardiac  arrhythmogenesis.  In  addition, 
drugs that reduce INa also reduce the transient inward current, relieve 
Ca2+ overload, and can abolish DADs. DADs most likely play a caus-
ative role in arrhythmogenesis in the failing heart, where upregulation 
of INa/Ca, in combination with downregulation of the inward rectifier 
K+ current IK1, facilitates DAD generation (see Fig. 33-20).52

Although  a  causal  role  of  spontaneous  SR  Ca2+  release  events  in 
triggering  DADs  in  isolated  cardiomyocytes  is  generally  accepted, 
little  is  known  about  whether  or  how  calcium  waves  within  the 
heart  actually  produce  arrhythmogenic  membrane  depolarizations. 
A  study  using  simultaneous  optical  mapping  of  changes  in  [Ca2+]i 
and  membrane  potential  with  cellular  resolution  in  the  intact,  iso-
lated  perfused  rat  heart  demonstrated  that  the  occurrence  of  trig-
gered activity requires the synchronous appearance of Ca2+ waves in 
multiple,  adjacent  cardiomyocytes.  In  contrast,  sporadic  Ca2+  waves 
in  individual  cardiomyocytes  never  gave  rise  to  triggered  activity 
(Fig. e33-10).84

A recent dual-voltage (Vm) and Ca2+ optical mapping study similarly 
investigated the mechanism by which Ca2+-induced DADs are synchro-
nized  in  the  myocardium  in  response  to  beta-adrenergic  receptor

6) accompanies a single event of triggered activity (red asterisk), followed by Ca2+ oscillations (green trace), with concomitant membrane fluctuations (red trace) showing a 
gradual reduction in amplitude. Only the first Ca2+ wave (red arrowhead), not the following three, triggers a propagating impulse. Fluorescence intensities of the calcium- and 
voltage-sensitive dyes fluo-4 and RH237, respectively, were measured in adjacent subepicardial ventricular myocytes within a Langendorff-perfused rat heart with dual-view, 
rapid scanning confocal microscopy. The triggered activity was induced by 2-Hz pacing under low K+ (2.4 mmol/L) perfusion and isoproterenol (3 nmol/L). B, Simultaneous Vm 
and intracellular Ca2+ recordings during the triggered beat demarcated by the red arrowhead in A at an expanded time scale demonstrate that the increase in [Ca2+]i precedes 
membrane depolarization. FI = fluorescence intensity. (Modified from Fujiwara K, Tanaka H, Mani H, et al: Burst emergence of intracellular Ca2+ waves evokes arrhythmogenic

FIGURE33-21  Proposed scheme of events leading to DADs and triggered tachyarrhythmia. Top panel, Congenital 
(e.g., gain-of-function mutations in the RYR2 or CASQ2 genes) or acquired factors (e.g., ischemia, hypertrophy, increased 
sympathetic tone, heart failure) will cause a diastolic Ca2+ leak through RyR2 that results in localized and transient increases 
in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes. Middle panel, Representative series of images showing changes in [Ca2+]i during a Ca2+ wave 
in a single cardiomyocyte loaded with a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye. Images were obtained at 117-millisecond intervals. 
Focally elevated Ca2+ (2) diffuses to the adjacent junctional SR, where it initiates more Ca2+ release events that result in 
a propagating Ca2+ wave (3 to 8). Bottom panel, The Ca2+ wave, through activation of inward INa/Ca, will depolarize the 
cardiomyocyte  (DAD).  If  of  sufficient  magnitude  to  overcome  the  source-sink  mismatch,  the  DAD  will  depolarize  the 
cardiomyocyte above threshold and result in a single or repetitive premature heartbeat (red arrows), which can trigger an 
arrhythmia. Downregulation of the inwardly rectifying potassium current (IK1), upregulation of INa/Ca, and shortened Ca2+ 
signaling refractoriness because of ryanodine receptor phosphorylation and/or oxidation can promote the generation of 
DAD-triggered action potentials. S = stimulus. (Modified from Rubart M, Zipes DP: Mechanisms of sudden cardiac death. 
J Clin Invest 115:2305, 2005. With permission from the Journal of Clinical Investigation.)

Short coupling intervals and pacing at 
rates more rapid than the triggered activ-
ity  rate  (overdrive  pacing)  increase  the 
amplitude  and  shorten  the  cycle  length 
of  the  DAD  after  cessation  of  pacing 
(overdrive acceleration) rather than sup-
pressing  and  delaying  the  escape  rate  
of  the  afterdepolarization,  as  in  normal 
automatic mechanisms. Premature stim-
ulation exerts a similar effect: the shorter 
the  premature  interval,  the  larger  the 
amplitude  and  the  shorter  the  escape 
interval of the triggered event.

The  clinical  implication  might  be 
that tachyarrhythmias caused by DAD-
triggered  activity  may  not  be  sup-
pressed  easily  or 
indeed  may  be 
precipitated by rapid rates, either spon-
taneously (such as with sinus tachycar-
dia)  or  induced  by  pacing.  Finally, 
because  a  single  premature  stimulus 
can  both  initiate  and  terminate  trig-
gered  activity,  differentiation 
from 
reentry  (see  later)  becomes  difficult. 
The response to overdrive pacing may 
help  separate  triggered  arrhythmias 
from reentrant arrhythmias.

Early Afterdepolarizations
Various  interventions,  each  of  which 
results  in  an  increase  in  intracellular 
positivity,  can  cause  EADs.  EADs  may 
be responsible for the lengthened repo-
larization time and ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias  seen 
in  several  clinical 
situations,  such  as  the  acquired  and 
congenital  forms  of  LQTS  (see  Fig. 
33-19;  see  Chapter  37).87  Left  ansa 
subclavian  stimulation  increases  the 
amplitude  of  cesium-induced  EADs  in 
dogs and the prevalence of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias more than right ansa 
subclavian  stimulation  does,  possibly 
because of a greater quantitative effect 
of the left than of the right stellate gan-
glion on the left ventricle.

tachyarrhythmias 

Long-QT Syndrome
Patients  with  heritable  LQTS  have  an 
abnormally  prolonged  cardiac  action 
potential duration and are at increased 
risk  for  sudden  cardiac  death  from  
(see 
ventricular 
Chapters  32  and  37).  The  genesis  of 
LQTS-associated  ventricular  tachycar-
dia or fibrillation is uncertain. Evidence 
is mounting that an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration related 
to  spontaneous  release  of  Ca2+  from  the  SR  in  cardiomyocytes, 
coupled with dispersion of repolarization, plays a causative role in 
LQTS-associated  cardiac  arrhythmia  and  sudden  cardiac  death. 
Action  potential  prolongation  may  increase  influx  of  Ca2+  through 
L-type  Ca2+  channels  during  a  cardiac  cycle  and  cause  excessive 
accumulation of Ca2+ in the SR and spontaneous release of Ca2+ from 
the SR. The ensuing elevation of intracellular free calcium can depo-
larize  cardiomyocyte  membrane  potential  by  activation  of  Ca2+-
dependent  chloride  currents,  the  electrogenic  Na+/Ca2+  exchange 
current,  or  both,  thereby  evoking  EADs.  EADs  can  trigger  a  propa-
gated response and thus elicit an extra beat, which can potentially 
launch a tachycardia.

Genetically  modified  mice  have  been  used  extensively  to  model 
congenital arrhythmogenic disorders, including LQTS. However, the 

stimulation to overcome the source-sink mismatch and generate focal 
arrhythmias.85  In  this  study,  local  intramyocardial  injection  of  the 
sympathetic  neurotransmitter  norepinephrine  was  used  to  induce   
triggered  arrhythmias.  Spatial  patterns  of  Vm-Ca2+  delay  during 
norepinephrine-induced PVCs were compared with sinus rhythm, ven-
tricular pacing, and normal Tyrode solutioninduced PVCs, as shown 
in Figure e33-11.

Another  study  involving  isolated  left  ventricular  cardiomyocytes 
from failing canine hearts suggested shortened Ca2+ signaling refrac-
toriness  because  of  altered  post-translational  modification  of  the 
ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel as a mechanism responsible 
for  the  increased  incidence  of  diastolic  Ca2+  waves  associated  with 
this disease and could provide an additional substrate for synchroni-
zation  of  arrhythmogenic  events  at  the  tissue  level  in  hearts  prone   
to VF.86

usefulness of this approach is limited because of the profound differ-
ences  in  electrophysiologic  properties  between  the  murine  and 
human  heart.  The  ability  to  generate  patient-specific  human  iPSCs 
offers  a  new  paradigm  for  modeling  human  disease.  Recently, 
several  research  groups  have  independently  reported  successful 
derivation of functional cardiomyocytes from LQTS patientspecific 
human iPSC lines. Electrophysiologic evaluation of LQTS cardiomy-
ocytes demonstrated that they recapitulate the disease phenotype in 
vitro, including marked action potential prolongation and increased 
susceptibility  to  spontaneous  or  pharmacologically  induced  trig-
gered  activity.88,89  An  example  of  such  a  study  in  cardiomyocytes 
derived from LQTS patientspecific iPSCs is summarized in Figure 
e33-12.

Large-scale  production  of  human  iPSCderived  cardiomyocytes 
has  made  it  possible  to  generate  sufficient  numbers  of  uniform 
cardiac  monolayers  that  can  be  used  for  the  study  of  arrhythmia 
mechanisms in vitro.90 Collectively, pluripotent stem cell technology 
now offers a unique platform to evaluate patient-specific arrhythmia 
mechanisms and to optimize patient therapy.

Experimental observations have also suggested an important role 
of transmural or longitudinal heterogeneity of repolarization. Marked 
transmural  dispersion  of  repolarization  can  create  a  vulnerable 
window  for  the  development  of  reentry.  Direct  experimental  evi-
dence of the existence of transmural dispersion in the action poten-
tial has been provided for the human heart.91 Optical voltage mapping 
of arterially perfused wedges from human hearts revealed significant 
transmural action potential gradients in the nonfailing heart ranging 
from  a  mean  of  383  milliseconds  (action  potential  duration  at  80% 
repolarization) in the subepicardium to a mean of 494 milliseconds 
in the endocardium. Three of five hearts studied showed midmyocar-
dial islands of cells that had distinctly long action potential durations 
averaging 537 milliseconds and a steep local action potential dura-
tion gradient of 27 msec/mm. In contrast, failing hearts were observed 
to have a significantly reduced transmural gradient averaging 29 mil-
liseconds and to lack islands of cells with delayed repolarization. The 
ionic mechanisms underlying transmural dispersion of repolarization 
in the human heart are currently unknown but may involve spatial 
variations in expression of the transient outward potassium current 
Ito and the delayed rectifying potassium current IKs (see Table 33-3).
Sympathetic stimulation, primarily left, can increase the EAD ampli-
tude  to  provoke  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias.  Alpha-adrenoceptor 
stimulation  also  increases  the  amplitude  of  cesium-induced  EADs 
and  the  prevalence  of  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias,  both  of  which 
are suppressed by magnesium.

In patients with acquired LQTS and torsades de pointes from drugs 
such  as  quinidine,  N-acetylprocainamide,  cisapride,  erythromycin, 
and some class III antiarrhythmic agents, EADs can also be respon-
sible (see Chapters 9 and 35). Such drugs easily elicit EADs experi-
mentally  and  clinically,  whereas  magnesium  suppresses  them.  It  is 
possible that multiple drugs can cause summation effects to provoke 
EADs and torsades de pointes in patients. Activators of ATP-dependent 
potassium channels, such as pinacidil and nicorandil, can eliminate 
EADs.

Parasystole
Classically, parasystole has been likened to the function of a fixed-
rate,  asynchronously  discharging  pacemakerits  timing  is  not 
altered by the dominant rhythm, it produces depolarization when the 
myocardium is excitable, and the intervals between discharges are 
multiples  of  a  basic  interval  (see  Chapters  36  and  37).  Complete 
entrance  block,  constant  or  intermittent,  insulates  and  protects  the 
parasystolic focus from surrounding electrical events and accounts 
for  such  behavior.  On  occasion,  the  focus  can  exhibit  exit  block, 
during which it may fail to depolarize excitable myocardium. In fact, 
the dominant cardiac rhythm may modulate parasystolic discharge 
to speed up or to slow down its rate. Brief subthreshold depolariza-
tions induced during the first half of the cardiac cycle of a spontane-
ously  discharging  pacemaker  delay  the  subsequent  discharge, 
whereas  similar  depolarizations  induced  in  the  second  half  of  the 
cardiac cycle accelerate it (Fig. e33-13).

DisordersofImpulseConduction
Conduction  delay  and  block  can  result  in  bradyarrhythmias  or 
tachyarrhythmias.  Bradyarrhythmias  occur  when  the  propagating 
impulse  is  blocked  and  is  followed  by  asystole  or  a  slow  escape 
rhythm; tachyarrhythmias occur when the delay and block produce 
reentrant excitation (see later). Various factors involving both active 
and passive membrane properties determine the conduction velocity 
of  an  impulse  and  whether  conduction  is  successful.  Among  these 
factors are the stimulating efficacy of the propagating impulse, which 
is related to the amplitude and rate of rise of phase 0; the excitability 
of the tissue into which the impulse is conducted; and the geometry 
of the tissue.

Deceleration-Dependent Block
Diastolic depolarization has been suggested as a cause of conduction 
block at slow rates, so-called bradycardia- or deceleration-dependent 
block  (see  Chapter  37).  However,  excitability  and  the  speed  of 
impulse  propagation  increase  as  the  membrane  depolarizes  until 
approximately 70 mV despite a reduction in action potential ampli-
tude and  (cid:31)Vmax  (supernormal conduction). Experiments in Purkinje 
fiber bundles have demonstrated that diastolic (phase 4) depolariza-
tion is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of deceleration-
dependent block.92 Evidently, depolarization-induced inactivation of 
fast Na+ channels is offset by other factors, such as a reduction in the 
difference between membrane potential and threshold potential and 
an increase in membrane excitability.

Tachycardia-Dependent Block
More commonly, impulses are blocked at rapid rates or short cycle 
lengths as a result of incomplete recovery of refractoriness (postrepo-
larization  refractoriness)  caused  by  incomplete  time-  or  voltage-
dependent  recovery  of  excitability.93  For  example,  such  incomplete 
recovery  is  the  usual  mechanism  responsible  for  a  nonconducted 
premature  P  wave  or  one  that  conducts  with  a  functional  bundle 
branch block.

Decremental Conduction
Decremental  conduction  is  a  term  used  commonly  in  the  clinical 
literature  but  is  often  misapplied  to  describe  any  Wenckebach-like 
conduction block, that is, responses similar to a block in the AV node 
during  which  progressive  conduction  delay  precedes  the  noncon-
ducted impulse. Correctly used, decremental conduction refers to a 
situation in which the properties of the fiber change along its length 
such that the action potential loses its efficacy as a stimulus to excite 
the fiber ahead of it. Thus the stimulating efficacy of the propagating 
action  potential  diminishes  progressively,  possibly  as  a  result  of  its 
decreasing amplitude and decreasing  (cid:31)Vmax .

Reentry
Electrical  activity  during  each  normal  cardiac  cycle  begins  in  the 
sinoatrial  node  and  continues  until  the  entire  heart  has  been  acti-
vated. Each cell becomes activated in turn, and the cardiac impulse 
dies  out  when  all  fibers  have  been  discharged  and  are  completely 
refractory. During this absolute refractory period, the cardiac impulse 
has  no  place  to  go.  It  must  be  extinguished  and  restarted  by  the 
next sinus impulse. If, however, a group of fibers not activated during 
the initial wave of depolarization recovers excitability in time to be 
discharged before the impulse dies out, the fibers may serve as a link 
to reexcite areas that were just discharged and have now recovered 
from the initial depolarization. Such a process has been given various 
namesreentry,  reentrant  excitation,  circus  movement,  reciprocal 
or  echo  beat,  or  reciprocating  tachycardiaall  meaning  approxi-
mately the same thing.

Entrainment
Entraining the tachycardia (i.e., increasing the rate of the tachycardia 
by pacing), with resumption of the intrinsic rate of the tachycardia 
when  pacing  is  stopped,  establishes  the  presence  of  reentry  (Fig. 
33-22A). Entrainment represents capture or continuous resetting of 
the  reentrant  circuit  of  the  tachycardia  by  the  pacing-induced

FIGUREe33-13  Modulation of pacemaker activity by subthreshold current pulses 
in diseased human ventricle. A, Two recording sites along the same trabecula in a 
spontaneously  active  preparation.  Current  pulses  (indicated  by  the red  dots)  of  30 
milliseconds in duration were injected through the lower microelectrode at various 
times. The interval between the spontaneous action potentials is given in milliseconds 
above each cycle. Injection of a subthreshold current pulse through the lower micro-
electrode relatively early in the spontaneous cycle (680 msec after initiation of the 
rapid portion of the preceding action potential upstroke) produced a subthreshold 
depolarization in the upper recording and delayed the next spontaneous discharge by 
400 to 1900 milliseconds. This response curve would fall in the first half of the curve 
indicated in C. A current pulse of the same intensity and duration delivered later in 
the spontaneous cycle (950 msec after the preceding upstroke) accelerated the next 
discharge by 210 to 1390 milliseconds relative to the previous two action potentials. 
The response to this current injection falls in the second half of the graph depicted 
in C. B, A stimulus at a precise interval in the cardiac cycle (called the singular point; 
in this example, 930 msec after the preceding action potential upstroke) abolishes 
pacemaker activity. C, Phase-response curves from experimental data obtained in ca-
nine Purkinje fibers in a manner similar to that in the human experiment shown in A 
and B. Two different runs are shown. The ordinate in this graph is the percent age 
increase or decrease in spontaneous cycle length of the parasystolic focus (control 
cycle length equals 100%); the abscissa is the percentage of the parasystolic focus 
spontaneous cycle length during which stimulation was performed. The spontaneous 
cycle length was maximally prolonged (by 26%) or shortened (by 20%) by subthresh-
old depolarizations that entered the parasystolic focus after approximately 50% and 
60%  of  the  cycle  had  elapsed,  respectively.  Very  similar  curves  can  be  plotted  for 
patients with parasystole (e.g., see Figs. 9 and 10 in Zipes DP: Plenary lecture. Cardiac

activation. Each pacing stimulus creates a wave front that travels in 
an  anterograde  direction  (orthodromic)  and  resets  the  tachycardia 
to the pacing rate. A wave front propagating retrogradely in the oppo-
site direction (antidromic) collides with the orthodromic wave front 
of  the  previous  beat  (Fig.  33-22B).  These  wave  front  interactions 
create electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features that can 
be explained only  by reentry. Therefore the  criteria  of entrainment 
can be used to prove the reentrant mechanism of a clinical tachycar-
dia  and  form  the  basis  for  localizing  the  pathway  traveled  by  the 
tachycardia  wave  front.  Such  localization  is  essential  for  ablation 
therapy.

Anatomic Reentry
Studies on reentry have used models with anatomically defined sepa-
rate pathways in which it could be shown that they had an area of 
unidirectional block and recirculation of the impulse to its point of

subsequent panels. A, right, RV pacing in the setting of sinus rhythm. B, RV pacing 
at a cycle length (CL) slightly shorter than VT produces a QRS complex that is a blend 
between fully VT and fully paced (fusion) complexes. All recordings are accelerated

complex is identical and the last beat is entrained, but surface fusion is absent. C, D,

appears to be more similar to pacing than it does to VT as the pacing CL shortens. 
B-D, Progressive degrees of fusion on the electrocardiogram. The Map recording of B 
through D also shows a progression of fusion, with both the morphology and timing 
of a portion of the electrogram changing with faster pacing. E, Finally, a still shorter 
paced CL results in a sudden change in both the Map electrogram (block in the small 
diastolic potential, red arrowhead) and the surface electrocardiogram, which is now 
fully paced. When pacing ceases, VT has been interrupted. F, Diagrammatic repre-
sentation of the reentrant circuit during spontaneous atrial flutter (AFL) and transient

f = circulating wave front of the AFL. Center, Introduction of the first pacing impulse 
(X) during rapid pacing from a high atrial site during AFL. The large arrow indicates 
entry  of  the  pacing  impulse  into  the  reentrant  circuit,  whereupon  it  is  conducted 
orthodromically (Ortho) and antidromically (Anti). The antidromic wave front of the 
pacing impulse (X) collides with the previous beat, in this case the circulating wave 
front of the spontaneous AFL (f), which results in an atrial fusion beat and, in effect, 
terminates the AFL. However, the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse 
(X) continues the tachycardia and resets it to the pacing rate. Right, Introduction of 
the next pacing impulse (X + 1) during rapid pacing from the same high atrial site. 
The large arrow again indicates entry of the pacing impulse into the reentrant circuit, 
whereupon it is conducted orthodromically and antidromically. Once again, the antid-
romic wave front from the pacing impulse (X + 1) collides with the orthodromic wave 
front of the previous beat. In this case it is the orthodromic wave front of the previous 
paced beat (X), and an atrial fusion beat results. The orthodromic wave front from the 
pacing impulse (X + 1) continues the tachycardia and resets it to the pacing rate. In 
all three parts, arrows indicate the direction of spread of the impulses; the serpentine 
line indicates slow conduction through a presumed area of slow conduction (stippled 
region) in the reentrant circuit; and the red dots with tails indicate bipolar electrodes 
at the high atrial pacing site, the posteroinferior portion of the left atrium (PLA), and 
another atrial site. (A-E, From Zipes DP: A century of cardiac arrhythmia: In search of

origin.  An  example  using  AV  nodal  reentry  is  illustrated  in  Figure 
33-23.  Because  the  two  pathways  have  different  electrophysiologic 
properties (e.g., shorter refractory period and slower conduction in 
one pathway versus a longer refractory period and faster conduction 
of the other), the impulse is first blocked in one pathway with a longer 
refractory  period  (green  area  in  Fig.  33-23)  and  then  propagates 
slowly in the adjacent pathway whose refractory period is shorter (red 
area in Fig. 33-23A, right panel). If conduction in this alternative route 
is  sufficiently  depressed,  the  slowly  propagating  impulse  excites 
tissue  beyond  the  blocked  pathway  (see  Fig.  33-23A,  right  panel, 
dashed yellow arrow) and returns in a reversed direction along the 
pathway  initially  blocked  to  reexcite  tissue  proximal  to  the  site  of 
block.  A  clinical  arrhythmia  caused  by  anatomic  reentry  is  most 
likely to have a monomorphic contour (Video 33-3).11

For reentry of this type to occur, the time for conduction within the 
depressed  but  unblocked  area  and  for  excitation  of  the  distal  seg-
ments  must  exceed  the  refractory  period  of  the  initially  blocked 
pathway  (Fig.  33-24A;  also  see  Fig.  33-23  and  Video  33-4,  which 
shows  electrical  reentry  in  the  infarct  border  zone)  and  the  tissue 
proximal to the site of block. Stated another way, continuous reentry 
requires the anatomic length of the circuit traveled to equal or exceed 
the reentrant wavelength. The latter is equal to the mean conduction 
velocity of the impulse multiplied by the longest refractory period of 
the elements in the circuit. Both values can be different at different 
points along the reentry pathway, and thus the wavelength value is 
somewhat contrived.

Conditions for Reentry
The length of the pathway is fixed and determined by the anatomy. 
Conditions that depress conduction velocity or abbreviate the refrac-
tory  period  promote  the  development  of  reentry  in  this  model, 
whereas prolonging refractoriness and speeding conduction velocity

site  is  marked  by  a  red  sphere  in  sequence  1  and  2.  Activation 
sequences 1 and 2 were obtained during subepicardial pacing at a 
coupling interval of 157 ms. Propagation of beat 1 is blocked within 
the  subepicardial  border  zone,  but  not  across  the  junction  of  the 
border zone and the midwall or at the network boundary (green line), 
which connects the subepicardial and subendocardial border zones, 
although at reduced propagation speed. Paced beat 2 fails to propa-
gate from the border zone to the midwall (unidirectional block) and 
stable  re-entrant  activation  occurs.  (From  Rutherford  SL,  Trew  ML,

FIGURE 33-23  Simulation  of  reentry  in  a  model  of  the  AV  node.  A,  Electri-
cal  stimuli  are  applied  to  the  His  bundle  (yellow  point)  by  using  an  S1-S2  protocol 
(S1-S2  interval,  96  milliseconds).  The  activation  sequences  (shown  as  isochrones  at 
5-millisecond intervals) in response to S1 and S2 stimuli are shown. Arrows highlight 
the  conduction  pathways.  Two  stimuli  are  delivered.  The  S1  action  potential  exits 
into the atrial muscle via the transitional tissue (green area), the putative fast pathway. 
The premature S2 action potential fails to exit via the transitional tissue because the 
S1-S2 interval is shorter than the refractory period of the transitional tissue. Instead, 
the S2 action potential exits into atrial muscle via the inferior nodal extension (INE, the 
putative slow pathway; red area) because the refractory period of the INE is shorter. 
The conduction velocity within the INE is low, as indicated by the isochrone crowding 
within the red area. The action potential then propagates anterogradely along the 
fast  pathway  (transitional  tissue  is  no  longer  refractory)  back  into  the  His  bundle.  
B, Simulated action potentials (at the high and low crista terminalis, interatrial sep-
tum, and His bundle) at different time points on the reentry circuit during S1-S2 stimu-
lation. The S2 action potential retrogradely excites atrial tissue (the action potential at 
the low crista terminalis appears first) and then anterogradely the His bundle, thereby 
completing  one  reentry  cycle.  The  reentry  beat  propagates  along  the  INE  and  out 
into the atrial muscle once more but then fails to anterogradely reexcite the His bun-
dle.  Color  coding  of  the  various  tissue  types  is  the  same  as  in  Figure  33-7.  (From 
Li  J,  Greener  ID,  Inada  S,  et al:  Computer  three-dimensional  reconstruction  of  the

can hinder it. For example, if conduction velocity (0.30 m/sec) and 
refractoriness (350 milliseconds) for ventricular muscle were normal, 
a pathway of 105 mm (0.30 m/sec × 0.35 sec) would be necessary for 
reentry  to  occur.  However,  under  certain  conditions,  conduction 
velocity in ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers can be very slow 
(0.03 m/sec), and if refractoriness is not greatly prolonged (600 mil-
liseconds), a pathway of only 18 mm (0.03 m/sec × 0.60 sec) may be 
necessary. Such reentry frequently exhibits an excitable gap, that is, 
a time interval between the end of refractoriness from one cycle and 
the beginning of depolarization in the next, when tissue in the circuit 
is  excitable.  This  condition  results  because  the  wavelength  of  the 
reentrant  circuit  is  less  than  the  length  of  the  pathway.  Electrical 
stimulation  during  this  period  can  invade  the  reentrant  circuit  and 
reset  its  timing  or  terminate  the  tachycardia.  Although  microana-
tomic reentry (confinement of the reentrant circuit to a few adjacent 
myocytes) has been postulated to occur in fibrotic myocardium,93 its 
occurrence  in  intact  heart  muscle  has  not  been  demonstrated 
directly.  This  difficulty  results  from  the  inability  to  unambiguously 
distinguish microreentry from triggered activity with currently avail-
able techniques.

Rapid  pacing  can  entrain  the  tachycardia,  that  is,  continuously 
reset  it  by  entering  the  circuit  and  propagating  around  it  in  the  
same way as the reentrant impulse, which increases the tachycardia 
rate  to  the  pacing  rate  without  terminating  the  tachycardia  (see

Fig.  33-22).  In  reentrant  circuits  with  an  excitable  gap,  conduction 
velocity  determines  the  revolution  time  of  the  impulse  around  the 
circuit  and  therefore  the  rate  of  the  tachycardia.  Prolongation  of 
refractoriness, unless it is long enough to eliminate the excitable gap 
and make the impulse propagate in relatively refractory tissue, does 
not influence the revolution time around the circuit or the rate of the 
tachycardia.  Anatomic  reentry  occurs  in  patients  with  Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome, in AV nodal reentry, in some atrial flut-
ters,  in  some  ventricular  tachycardias,  and  in  VF.  For  example, 
mapping studies in isolated ovine atria have demonstrated key roles 
of anatomic structures (e.g., fibrotic patches) in the maintenance of 
reentry during fibrillation.94

in  contiguous  fibers 

Functional Reentry
Functional  reentry  lacks  confining  anatomic  boundaries  and  can 
occur 
that  exhibit  functionally  different  
electrophysiologic  properties  caused  by  local  differences  in  trans-
membrane  action  potential  (e.g.,  Purkinje-myocyte  transition).  Dis-
persion of excitability, refractoriness, or both, as well as anisotropic 
distributions  of  intercellular  resistance,  permit  initiation  and  main-
tenance  of  reentry.  Functional  heterogeneity  in  the  electrophysio-
logic  properties  of  the  myocardium  has  been  shown  to  contribute 
to  the  generation  and  maintenance  of  tachycardia  and  fibrillation. 
These  heterogeneities  can  be  fixed,  as  in  the  case  of  spatial  redis-
tribution  of  gap  junctions  in  the  failing  heart49  or  infarct  border 
zone  or  in  the  case  of  spatial  gradients  in  the  magnitude  of  the 
background K+ current IK1 (see Fig. 33-24B).95 They can also change 
dynamically, as in an acutely ischemic myocardium96 or in the pres-
ence  of  repolarization-prolonging  agents.97  A  very  important  deter-
minant  of  the  dynamically  induced  component  of  heterogeneity 
has  been  identified  as  electrical  restitution,  or  variation  of  the 
action potential duration and conduction velocity with the diastolic 
interval.98 It has been proposed that the breakup of periodic waves 
is  precipitated  by  oscillations  in  the  action  potential  duration 
(so-called  action  potential  duration  alternans)  of  sufficiently  large 
amplitude to cause conduction block along a spiral wave front (see 
Fig. 33-27).

TachycardiasCausedbyReentry
Reentry is probably the cause of many tachyarrhythmias, including 
various types of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias, flutter, 
and fibrillation (see Chapter 37).

Atrial Flutter
Reentry is the most likely cause of the usual form of atrial flutter, with 
the reentrant circuit being confined to the right atrium in typical atrial 
flutter,  where  it  usually  travels  counterclockwise  in  a  caudocranial 
direction in the interatrial septum and in a craniocaudal direction in 
the right atrial free wall. An area of slow conduction is present in the 
posterolateral to posteromedial inferior area of the right atrium, along 
with a central area of block that can include an anatomic (inferior 
vena cava) and functional component. This area of slow conduction 
is  rather  constant  and  represents  the  site  of  successful  ablation  of 
atrial  flutter.  Ablation  results  are  consistent  with  a  macroreentry 
circuit.

Different  reentrant  circuits  exist  in  patients  with  other  types  of 
atrial flutter, such as those that occur after surgery or ablation or are 
associated with an atrial septal defect (see Chapter 62).

Atrial Fibrillation
Spatiotemporal Organization and Focal Discharge
According  to  the  multiple-wavelet  hypothesis,  AF  is  characterized  
by  fragmentation  of  the  wave  front  into  multiple  daughter  wavelets 
(see Chapter 38). They wander randomly throughout the atrium and 
give rise to new wavelets that collide with each other and are mutu-
ally  annihilated  or  that  give  rise  to  new  wavelets  in  a  perpetual 
activity.

The randomness of the irregular electrical activity during AF has 
been  disputed  on  the  basis  of  both  statistical  methods  and

was progressively reduced until block occurred. The upper panel shows action potential traces at the subepicardial border zone (red), midwall (green), and subendocardial border 
zone (blue) sites indicated by arrows in panel 1. Numbers above the action potential trace correspond to the voltage activation sequences of beats 1 to 6. Beats 1 and 2 are paced 
with a coupling interval (S1-S2) of 157 milliseconds. Propagation of beat 1 is blocked within the subepicardial border zone (arrowhead) but not at the junction of the border zone 
and the midwall (solid white line) or at the network boundary (dashed line), although conduction along these paths is slow. Beat 2 fails to propagate from the border zone to the 
midmyocardium (unidirectional block), and sustained reentrant activation occurs in beats 3 to 6. (For more on the activation time series, see Video 33-4.) B, Spiral wave model.

experimental studies. A combination of high-resolution video imaging, 
recordings of the electrocardiogram, and spectral analysis was used 
to  demonstrate  that  reentry  in  anatomically  or  functionally  deter-
mined circuits forms the basis of spatiotemporal periodicity during 
acute AF. The cycle length of the source in the left atrium determines 
the dominant peak in the frequency spectra. The underlying periodic-
ity may stem from a repetitive focal source of activity propagated from 
an individual pulmonary vein or left atrial site to the remainder of the 
atrium as fibrillating waves. If a single repetitive focal source of activity 
that undergoes fractionation underlies the maintenance of AF, abla-
tion of this focal source should interrupt AF. Indeed, delivery of radio-
frequency  energy  to  discrete  sites  in  the  distal  pulmonary  veins  in 
humans has been shown to eliminate or reduce recurrence of AF. In a 
large animal model of inducible AF associated with heart failure, it 
was recently demonstrated that AF dynamics is characterized by rapid 
repetitive activation (resulting from either microanatomic reentry or 
triggered activity) revolving around fibrotic obstacles in the posterior 

left atrium or pulmonary vein ostia. Furthermore, fibrillatory activity 
was  maintained  by  intramural  reentry  centered  on  fibrotic  patches 
and  appeared  as  endocardial  breakthroughs  at  the  posterior  left 
atrium (endocardial breakthroughs are considered sudden and unex-
pected  appearances  of  localized  electrical  activity  not  related  to 
activation or slow conduction in the surrounding regions). In atria with 
heart failure, AF waves changed the origin and direction of propaga-
tion on a beat-to-beat basis, whereas in normal left atria, the break-
through sites and direction of activation of AF wave fronts were highly 
recurrent from one AF wave to the next (Fig. e33-14  and Video 33-5). 
Interestingly, numeric simulations of AF dynamics best recapitulated 
the  experimental  observations  in  this  study  when  cardiomyocytes 
were assumed to be electrotonically coupled to myofibroblasts, thus 
supporting  a  role  of  heterocellular  electrical  coupling  in  atrial 
arrhythmogenesis.94

Several  experimental  models  have  been  used  to  study  the  struc-
tural and basic electrophysiologic properties of pulmonary veins that

are thought to play a role in initiation and maintenance of AF. Mor-
phologic  studies  have  demonstrated  the  presence  of  complex  ana-
tomic  structures  and  phenotypically  different  cardiomyocytes  in 
pulmonary  veins.99,100  Electrophysiologic  studies  have  shown  that  a 
combination of reentrant and nonreentrant mechanisms (automatic-
ity and triggered activity) is the underlying arrhythmogenic mecha-
nism  for  initiation  of  AF  from  the  pulmonary  veins.100,101  Abnormal 
intracellular  calcium  handling  probably  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the 
pulmonary vein electrical activity. Dual mapping of cardiomyocyte 
membrane potential and intracellular free calcium has demonstrated 
the appearance of spontaneous calcium release events resulting in 
focal  discharge.90  The  role  of  dysfunction  of  calcium-handling  pro-
teins (e.g., Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, ryanodine receptor calcium release 
channels) in AF awaits further investigation.

Ion Channel Abnormalities in Atrial Fibrillation
Monogenic (Familial) Atrial Fibrillation.  Although familial forms 
of AF are relatively rare, identification of mutations in AF kindreds has 
provided valuable insight into the molecular pathways underlying the 
arrhythmia.102 Most mutations linked to familial AF have been located 
in genes that encode sodium or potassium channel subunits. Functional 
analyses of these mutations have revealed either gain-of-function or 
loss-of-function  effects.  Mutations  in  genes  encoding  pore-forming 
alpha  or  auxiliary  beta  subunits  of  the  delayed  rectifier  potassium 
channel and the voltage-gated sodium channel (IKs and INa, respectively; 
see Table 33-3) have been reported in familial AF. The mechanisms by 
which these mutations cause AF are not clearly understood. Gain-of-
function mutations in IKs give rise to increased repolarizing currents, 
which then shorten the action potential duration and atrial refractori-
ness,  thereby  facilitating  fibrillatory  activity.  An  augmented  inward 
sodium  current  can  induce  triggered  activity.  Conversely,  a  reduced 
inward  sodium  current  promotes  reentry  by  abbreviating  the  action 
potential  duration/refractoriness  and  thus  the  reentry  wavelength. 
Other  potassium  channel  mutations  associated  with  AF  have  been 
localized to the KCNJ2 and KCNA5 genes, which encode the inward 
rectifier and ultrarapid delayed rectifier potassium current, respectively 
(see Table 33-3). Finally, mutations in the GJA5 gene, which encodes 
the  gap  junction  channel  subunit  connexin  40,  have  been  linked  to 
familial AF. Functionally, abnormal intercellular electrical coupling can 
result in conduction heterogeneity and facilitate reentry.

Genome-Wide  Association  Studies  for  Lone  Atrial  Fibrilla-
tion.  Genome-wide  association  studies  have  identified  variations  in 
multiple genomic regions that are associated with lone AF.103,104 These 
regions  encode  ion  channels  (e.g.,  the  calcium-activated  potassium 
channel gene KCNN3 and the HCN channel gene HCN4), transcription 
factors related to cardiopulmonary development (e.g., the homeodo-
main  transcription  factor  PRRX1),  and  cell-signaling  molecules  (e.g., 
CAV1,  a  cellular  membrane  protein  involved  in  signal  transduction). 
The mechanistic links between these genetic variations and suscepti-
bility to AF remain to be determined.

A number of experimental studies have probed the primary role of 
abnormalities in ion channel expression or properties in causing AF. 
Rapid  pacinginduced  AF  in  dogs  causes  a  decrease  in  binding  of 
FKBP-12.6  to  the  ryanodine  receptor  Ca2+  release  channel  (see  Fig. 
e33-5), thereby resulting in diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage, which in turn, 
through  activation  of  Ca2+-sensitive  currents,  can  initiate  electrical 
instability and contribute to AF.105 Mice with a genetic gain-of-func-
tion defect in the gene encoding the type 2 ryanodine receptor exhibit 
increased  susceptibility  to  inducible  AF.  AF  induction  in  this  animal 
model may involve triggered activity arising from EADs, whereas main-
tenance  of  AF  requires  reentrant  activity.83  Cav1.3  Ca2+  channel
deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to inducible atrial flutter 
and  AF.106  Mice  in  which  the  gene  encoding  KCNE1,  an  auxiliary 
subunit  of  the  pore-forming  K+  channel  alpha  subunit  KCNQ1,  has 
been knocked out display frequent spontaneous episodes of AF.107

Electrical Remodeling of the Atria
Electrical remodeling of the atria appears to be a key determinant for 
maintenance of AF. Prolonged rapid atrial rates cause electrophysi-
ologic  alterations  in  the  atria,  including  shortening  and  loss  of  the 
physiologic rate adaptation of refractoriness and a decrease in con-
duction velocity. Because abbreviation of the atrial refractory period 
is disproportionately larger than the reduction in conduction velocity, 
the wavelength of the reentrant wavelets shortens and thereby pro-
motes reentrant activity.

655

The ionic basis of shortening of the refractory period and slowing of 
conduction may be a significant reduction in the density of the L-type 
Ca2+  and  the  fast  Na+  currents.  The  electrophysiologic  changes  are 
paralleled by similar decreases in messenger RNA levels of Ca2+ and 
Na+ channel genes, which suggests alterations in gene expression as 
the underlying molecular mechanisms of atrial electrical remodeling. 
Changes  in  the  density,  spatial  distribution,  or  both  of  various  con-
nexin types may also cause alterations in atrial impulse propagation. 
In addition, autonomic remodeling appears to play a key role in both 
triggering and maintaining AF. Long-term selective vagal denervation 
of  the  atria  and  sinoatrial  and  AV  nodes  prevents  induction  of  AF. 
Heterogeneous sympathetic denervation of the atria favors the devel-
opment of sustained AF.

Sinus Reentry
The sinoatrial node shares with the AV node electrophysiologic fea-
tures such as the potential for dissociation of conduction, that is, an 
impulse  can  be  conducted  in  some  nodal  fibers  but  not  in  others, 
thereby permitting reentry to occur (see Chapter 37). The reentrant 
circuit can be located entirely within the sinoatrial node or involve 
both  the  sinoatrial  node  and  atrium.  Supraventricular  tachycardias 
caused  by  sinus  node  reentry  are  generally  less  symptomatic  than 
other supraventricular tachycardias because of slower rates. Ablation 
of the sinoatrial node may occasionally be necessary for refractory 
tachycardia.

Atrial Reentry
Reentry within the atrium, unrelated to the sinoatrial node, can be a 
cause  of  supraventricular  tachycardia  in  humans.  Distinguishing 
atrial  tachycardia  caused  by  automaticity  or  afterdepolarizations 
from  atrial  tachycardia  sustained  by  reentry  over  small  areas  (i.e., 
microanatomic reentry) is difficult.

Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry
Differences in the electrical properties of the various tissue types that 
contribute  to  the  AV  node  are  responsible  for  AV  nodal  reentrant 
tachycardia (AVNRT; see Figs. 33-7 and 33-23). Optical mapping of AV 
nodal  transmembrane  action  potentials  during  echo  beats  reveals 
the reentrant pathways underlying the various types of AVNRT (Fig. 
33-25; see also Fig. 33-7 for nomenclature of the AV nodal regions). 
The reentrant pathway of the slow-fast type starts counterclockwise 
with a block in the fast pathway (the transitional zone; see the light 
green area in Fig. 33-7), delay in conduction across the slow pathway 
(the  inferior  nodal  extension;  see  the  red  area  in  Fig.  33-7)  to  the 
compact AV node (triangular-shaped, colored area to the left of black 
dot  4  in  Fig.  33-7),  exit  from  the  AV  node  to  the  fast  pathway,  and 
rapid return to the slow pathway through atrial tissue located at the 
base of the triangle of Koch. The reentrant circuit of the fast-slow type 
is clockwise. In the slow-slow type, anterograde conduction is over 
the intermediate pathway and retrograde conduction is over the slow 
pathway. Because slow-pathway conduction is involved in each type 
of  AVNRT,  ablation  of  the  slow  pathway  is  effective  for  all  types  of 
AVNRT. These results also demonstrate that atrial tissue surrounding 
the triangle of Koch is clearly involved in all three types of AV nodal 
reentry in these examples.

Preexcitation Syndrome
In  most  patients  who  have  reciprocating  tachycardias  associated 
with  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome,  the  accessory  pathway  con-
ducts more rapidly than the normal AV node but takes a longer time 
to  recover  excitability;  that  is,  the  anterograde  refractory  period  of 
the accessory pathway exceeds that of the AV node at long cycles. 
Consequently,  a  premature  atrial  complex  that  occurs  sufficiently 
early is blocked anterogradely in the accessory pathway and contin-
ues to the ventricle over the normal AV node and His bundle. After 
the  ventricles  have  been  excited,  the  impulse  is  able  to  enter  the 
accessory pathway retrogradely and return to the atrium. A continu-
ous conduction loop of this type establishes the circuit for the tachy-
cardia.  The  usual  (orthodromic)  activation  wave  during  such  a 
reciprocating  tachycardia  in  a  patient  with  an  accessory  pathway 
occurs anterogradely over the normal AV nodeHis-Purkinje system

and  retrogradely  over  the  accessory  pathway,  which  results  in  a 
normal QRS complex (Fig. 33-26).

Because  the  circuit  requires  both  atria  and  ventricles,  the  term 
supraventricular  tachycardia  is  not  precisely  correct,  and  the  tachy-
cardia is more accurately termed atrioventricular reciprocating tachy-
cardia (AVRT). The reentrant loop can be interrupted by ablation of 
the normal AV nodeHis bundle pathway or the accessory pathway. 
On  occasion,  the  activation  wave  travels  in  a  reverse  (antidromic) 
direction to the ventricles over the accessory pathway and to the atria 
retrogradely up the AV node. Two accessory pathways can form the 
circuit in some patients with antidromic AVRT. In some patients the 
accessory  pathway  may  be  capable  of  only  retrograde  conduction 
(concealed),  but  the  circuit  and  mechanism  of  AVRT  remain  the 
same.  Less  commonly,  the  accessory  pathway  can  conduct  only 
anterogradely. The pathway can be localized by analysis of the scalar 
electrocardiogram. Patients can have AF as well as AVRT. Develop-
mental studies in mice have demonstrated that myocardium-specific 
inactivation of T-box 2, a transcription factor essential for AV canal 
patterning, leads to the formation of fast-conducting accessory path-

ways, malformation of the annulus fibrosus, and ventricular preexci-
tation in mice (Fig. e33-15).108

Unusual accessory pathways with AV nodelike electrophysiologic 
properties, that is, nodofascicular or nodoventricular fibers, can con-
stitute the circuit for reciprocating tachycardias in patients who have 
some  form  of  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome.  Tachycardia  in 
patients with nodoventricular fibers can be caused by reentry, with 
these  fibers  being  used  as  the  anterograde  pathway  and  the  His-
Purkinje fibers and a portion of the AV node being used retrogradely. 
In the putative Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome (short PR interval and 
normal QRS complex), conduction over a James fiber that connects 
the atrium to the distal portion of the AV node and His bundle has 
been proposed, although little functional evidence exists to support 
the presence of this entity.

Ventricular Tachycardia Caused by Reentry
Reentry in the ventricle, both anatomic and functional, as a cause of 
sustained  ventricular  tachycardia  has  been  supported  by  many 
animal and clinical studies (see Fig. 33-24 and Chapter 37). Reentry 
in ventricular muscle, with or without contributions from specialized 
tissue,  is  responsible  for  many  or  most  ventricular  tachycardias  in 
patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease.  The  area  of  microreentry 
appears  to  be  small,  and  less  commonly  a  macroreentry  is  found 
around  the  infarct  scar.  Surviving  myocardial  tissue  separated  by 
connective tissue provides serpentine routes of activation traversing 
infarcted areas that can establish reentry pathways. Bundle branch 
reentry can cause sustained ventricular tachycardia, particularly in 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Both  figure-of-8  and  single-circle  reentrant  loops  have  been 
described  as  circulating  around  an  area  of  functional  block  in  a 
manner consistent with the leading circle hypothesis or as conduct-
ing slowly across an apparent area of block created by anisotropy.109 
When intramural myocardium survives, it can form part of the reen-
trant loop. Structural discontinuities that separate muscle bundles
as  a  result  of  naturally  occurring  myocardial  fiber  orientation  and 
anisotropic  conduction,  for  example,  as  well  as  collagen  matrices 
formed from the fibrosis after a myocardial infarctionestablish the 
basis for slowed conduction, fragmented electrograms, and continu-
ous electrical activity, which can lead to reentry. After the infarction, 
the  surviving  epicardial  border  zone  undergoes  substantial  electri-
cal  remodeling,110 
including  reduced  conduction  velocity  and 
increased  anisotropy  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  reentrant 
circuits and ventricular tachycardia.43 Slowing of conduction arises 
from  alterations  in  the  spatial  distribution  and  electrophysiologic 
properties  of  connexin  43  gap  junctions,43  as  well  as  from  reduced 
voltage-gated sodium current. Whether myocyte depolarization sec-
ondary  to  electrotonic  coupling  to  adjacent  myofibroblasts  (which 
typically  have  a  much  more  depolarized  potential)  plays  a  role  in 
electrical  remodeling  in  postinfarction  border  zone  myocardium 
remains to be seen.66 During acute ischemia, various factors, includ-
ing  elevated  [K]o  and  reduced  pH,  combine  to  create  depressed 
action  potentials  in  ischemic  cells  that  retard  conduction  and  can 
lead  to  reentry.  Indeed,  optical  mapping  studies  in  arterially  per-
fused  canine  wedge  preparations  during  global  no-flow  ischemia 
have  demonstrated  initiation  of  reentry  during  initial  ischemia  and 
subsequent  reperfusion  caused  by  the  unidirectional  block  of  con-
duction  resulting  from  the  spatiotemporal  dispersion  in  tissue 
responses  to  stimulation.97  The  rapidly  changing  combination  of 
transmural dispersion in response to endocardial pacing stimuli and 
the  velocity  of  conduction  creates  a  dynamic  substrate  in  which 
reentry can be initiated and sustained. The results of this study are 
compatible with previous observations that fibrillation during reper-
fusion can be caused by intramural reentry. Interestingly, transmural 
reentry under these experimental conditions could be triggered by 
epicardial but not by endocardial stimulation at a time when there 
was an epicardial conduction delay or block with preserved endo-
cardial  conduction  because  of  the  increased  susceptibility  of  the 
epicardium to the effects of ischemia. Clinically, this might facilitate 
induction of tachycardia by a PVC arising in the epicardium but not 
in the endocardium.

FIGUREe33-15  Accessory pathway formation in a mouse model of ventricular preexcitation. A, Surface electrocardiograms from an adult wild-type mouse and mouse with 
cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of T-box 2, a transcription factor essential for AV canal patterning during development. Myocardial T-box 2 deficiency resulted in a severely 
shortened PR interval with a broadened QRS complex and initial slurring consistent with ventricular preexcitation. The total activation time of the atria and ventricles with preex-
citation is less than the normal AV delay, thus indicating that the AV node is not used to activate (part of) the ventricle. Hence, these QRS complexes are not a representation of 
fusion of normal activation and preexcitation via the accessory pathway. B, Isochrone activation maps in an adult wild-type and T-box 2deficient heart. In the wild-type heart, 
after an AV delay of 34 milliseconds, the ventricle is activated from the apex to the base. In the T-box 2deficient heart, the ventricle is activated from the base to the apex after 
an AV delay of 9 milliseconds. C, Immunohistochemical analyses revealed connexin 43 expression (Cx43; green) in accessory myocardial connections between the left atrium 
(la) and the left ventricular (lv) base in the T-box 2deficient heart (blue: nuclei). (From Aanhaanen WT, Boukens BJ, Sizarov A, et al: Defective Tbx2-dependent patterning of the

FIGURE33-26  A, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Following high right atrial pacing at a cycle length of 500 milliseconds (S1-S1), premature stimulation at a coupling 
interval of 300 milliseconds (S1-S2) produces physiologic delay in AV nodal conduction, which results in an increase in the A-H interval from 100 to 140 milliseconds but no delay 
in the AV interval. Consequently, activation of the His bundle follows activation of the QRS complex (second interrupted line), and the QRS complex becomes more anomalous 
in appearance because of increased ventricular activation over the accessory pathway. B, Induction of reciprocating AV tachycardia. Premature stimulation at a coupling interval 
of 230 milliseconds prolongs the A-H interval to 230 milliseconds and results in anterograde block in the accessory pathway and normalization of the QRS complex (a slight 
functional aberrancy in the nature of incomplete right bundle branch block occurs). Note that H2 precedes onset of the QRS complex (interrupted line). Following V2, the atria 
are excited retrogradely (A) beginning in the distal coronary sinus, followed by atrial activation in leads recording from the proximal coronary sinus, His bundle, and high right 
atrium. A supraventricular tachycardia is initiated at a cycle length of 330 milliseconds. I, II, III, and V1 indicate scalar electrocardiographic leads. A = H-V, atrial, His bundle, and

Brugada Syndrome
Phase  2  reentry  has  been  implicated  in  the  genesis  of  ventricular 
tachycardia-fibrillation associated with the inheritable Brugada syn-
drome,111 which is characterized by ST-segment elevation (unrelated 
to ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, or structural heart disease) in 

the right precordial (V1 to V3) leads of the electrocardiogram, often 
but  not  always  accompanied  by  an  apparent  right  bundle  branch 
block.  The  hereditary  nature  of  the  syndrome  is  well  established. 
Brugada syndrome has been linked to loss-of-function mutations in 
SCN5A,  which  encodes  the  pore-forming  cardiac  sodium  channel

alpha  subunit  Nav1.5,  and  mutations  in  SCN1B,  which  encodes  the 
function-modifying  sodium  channel  beta1  subunit  (see  Chapter 
32).112,113 Although Na+ channel mutations are most common, muta-
tions in the alpha and beta subunits of the Ca2+ channel gene have 
been found in some patients with Brugada syndrome, as have muta-
tions in the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1like gene (GPD1L) 
on  chromosome  3p22-25  (BS2),  which  reduce  the  Na+  current  INa. 
Brugada syndromeassociated gene defects cause a reduction or loss 
of sodium or calcium current in combination with altered functional 
properties  of  voltage-gated  sodium  channels.  Alterations  in  the 
sodium channel current cause heterogeneous loss of the action poten-
tial dome during the plateau phase (phase 2) in the right ventricular 
epicardium, which leads to a marked dispersion of repolarization and 
refractoriness and the potential for phase 2 reentry.114 Ablation of right 
ventricular  epicardium  eliminated  ventricular  arrhythmias  in  an 
animal model of pharmacologically induced Brugada syndrome.111

Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia
CPVT is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease characterized by stress-
induced, adrenergically mediated polymorphic ventricular tachycar-
dia occurring in structurally normal hearts. Heterozygous missense 
mutations  in  the  gene  encoding  the  RyR2  have  been  reported  in  
most  patients  with  CPVT,  although  mutations  in  the  calsequestrin 
gene  can  also  cause  CPVT.115  A  common  mechanism  underlying 
RyR2-associated  CPVT  is  increased  leakage  of  Ca2+  from  the  SR 
during diastole leading to intracellular Ca2+ waves and triggered activ-
ity.76,116 Carvedilol, a beta blocker used for prevention of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias in heart failure, and flecainide, a blocker of voltage-
gated sodium channels, have recently been shown to suppress CPVT 
via  direct  inhibition  of  cardiac  ryanodine  receptormediated  Ca2+ 
release, thus indicating that these agents possess hitherto unknown 
pharmacologic properties that can be exploited for the treatment of 
Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias in the clinical setting.117,118

Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is also an 
inherited disease characterized by sustained monomorphic ventricu-
lar tachycardia and sudden death. Previous studies have linked ARVC 
with mutations in proteins of the cardiac desmosome, a component 
of the intercalated disc essential for mechanical coupling between 
cardiomyocytes.  Mutations  in  multiple  genes,  including  desmopla-
kin,  desmoglein  2,  desmocollin  2,  plakophilin  2,  plakoglobin  (JUP, 
also called gamma-catenin), ryanodine receptor 2, laminin receptor 
1,  and  transforming  growth  factor-beta  3,  have  been  identified  in 
patients  with  ARVC.  Approximately  70%  of  the  mutations  linked  to 
inherited ARVC are in the gene encoding plakophilin 2 (PKP2), which 
interacts with other cytoskeletal proteins to stabilize the desmosome. 
In  vitro  studies  have  demonstrated  that  loss  of  PKP2  expression 
reduces the voltage-gated sodium current and connexin 43 expres-
sion at the intercalated disc and thus results in slowed action poten-
tial propagation. Cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of JUP in mice 
has recently been shown to recapitulate many aspects of the human 
ARVC phenotype, including ventricular dilation, cardiac fibrosis, ven-
tricular dysfunction, and tachyarrhythmias.119

Ventricular Fibrillation: Initiation and Maintenance
Previous  experimental  and  simulation  investigations  have  suggested 
that VF is maintained solely by reentry (see Chapter 37). This reentry 
was thought to be unstable and to be maintained by wandering wave-
lets of activation following constantly changing paths of activation and 
exhibiting  frequent  conduction  block  caused  by  nonuniform  disper-
sion of refractoriness. More recent investigations have suggested other 
mechanisms of maintenance of VF and have introduced the concepts 
of  restitution  kinetics,  wave  front,  wave  break,  focal  discharge,  and 
rotor as replacement for the classic reentry theory.120 (For a demonstra-
tion of wave front dynamics during fibrillation, see Video 33-6.)

The  hallmark  of  cardiac  fibrillation  is  ongoing  wave  break  (or  wave 
splitting).121 Wave break is caused by a conduction block occurring at 
a specific site along the wave front while the remaining portions of 

the  front  continue  to  propagate.  This  localized  block,  wave  break, 
causes splitting of the mother wave front into two daughter wavelets. 
Two hypotheses exist in regard to the genesis of wave breaks during 
fibrillation. The mother rotor hypothesis states that VF is maintained 
by  a  single,  stationary,  intramural  stable  reentrant  circuit  (i.e.,  the 
mother rotor) in a dominant domain, which has the shortest refractory 
period from which activations propagate into the more slowly activat-
ing domains with longer refractory periods. Wave breaks result from 
Wenckebach-like  conduction  as  high-frequency  impulses  emanating 
from  the  dominant  domain  are  unable  to  sustain  1:1  conduction 
through heterogeneous tissue. In this case the fastest activating (i.e., 
dominating)  rotor  rather  than  ongoing  wave  break  is  the  engine 
driving  cardiac  fibrillation,  and  wave  break  occurs  only  second-
arily.120,122 Evidence supporting this concept is that frequency analyses 
have  shown  (1)  single,  stable  (both  in  space  and  time),  dominant 
frequencies  in  the  power  spectra  of  membrane  voltage  signals 
obtained from various regions of the heart; (2) correlation of dominant 
frequencies and the frequency of reentry; (3) relative infrequency of 
reentry on the surface of the heart during fibrillation, with an intra-
mural location of the mother rotor being favored, such as the Purkinje 
network; and (4) Wenckebach-like conduction at the borders between 
different dominant frequency domains. These borders can result from 
preexisting  structural  or  functional  heterogeneities.  For  example, 
high-resolution electrical mapping has suggested that fast activation 
during  VF  is  driven  by  Purkinje  fibers.  Spatial  heterogeneity  in  the 
magnitude of ionic currents has been implicated in the generation of 
spatial gradients in activation rates and in maintaining rotor stability 
in the fastest activating regions. For example, the magnitude of the 
inward  rectifying  K+  current  IK1  (see  Table  33-3)  was  larger  in  the 
rapidly activating left ventricular myocytes than in the slower activat-
ing right ventricular myocytes.78 Furthermore, regions with larger IK1 
had  faster  activation  rates  and  more  stable  rotors  than  did  regions 
with smaller IK1.77

In  contrast  to  the  stable  mother  rotor  theory,  other  experimental 
evidence  has  supported  the  idea  that  dynamic  wave  break  plays  a 
fundamental role in the initiation and maintenance of short-duration 
VF  (wandering  wavelet  hypothesis).120,121,123,124  According  to  this 
hypothesis, VF is maintained by wandering wavelets with constantly 
changing, evanescent, reentrant circuits. Experimental evidence favor-
ing the multiple-wavelet hypothesis includes (1) an inability to detect 
a single dominant frequency in the power spectra of mapping data 
from  fibrillating  hearts;  (2)  spatiotemporal  instability  of  frequency 
domain  distributions  during  VF,  with  the  exception  of  anatomic 
borders, such as the Purkinje-myocyte transition; (3) failure to dem-
onstrate  stable  intramural  reentry  at  higher  frequencies  than  at  the 
surface; and (4) boundaries dynamically generated by wavelet behav-
ior  rather  than  by  anatomic  conduction  block.  To  reproduce  the 
dynamic spatiotemporal instability of dominant frequency domains, a 
combination of dynamically changing and fixed tissue heterogeneity 
is  required.99  The  most  important  determinant  of  the  dynamically 
induced component of heterogeneity has been identified as electrical 
restitution, or variation of the action potential duration and conduc-
tion  velocity  with  the  diastolic  interval.  For  example,  it  has  been 
proposed that the breakup of periodic waves is precipitated by oscil-
lations  in  the  action  potential  duration  (so-called  action  potential 
duration alternans [APD alternans]) that are sufficiently large to cause 
a  conduction  block  along  the  spiral  wave  front.  Simulations  (Fig. 
33-27)  have  shown  that  a  reentrant  rotor  becomes  unstable  and 
breaks  down  into  multiple  rotors  when  the  slope  of  the  restitution 
curve for the action potential duration versus the diastolic interval is 
greater than 1. Pharmacologic blockade of the L-type calcium current 
can terminate VF by reducing the action potential duration restitution 
slope  (see  Fig.  33-27).125  If  it  is  occurring  in  a  spatially  discordant 
pattern, alternans is considered a key arrhythmogenic factor predis-
posing the heart to reentry and fibrillation.126 At the cellular level, the 
origin of APD alternans appears to be determined primarily by alterna-
tions  in  cardiomyocyte  calcium  transient  amplitude  or  duration 
(calcium alternans).

During spatially discordant alternans, the action potential duration 
alternates  out  of  phase  in  different  regions  of  the  heart,  thereby 
increasing  dispersion  of  refractoriness  so  that  ectopic  beats  have  a 
high probability of inducing reentry. This mechanism is illustrated in 
Figure  33-28;  some  regions  of  the  heart  alternate  in  a  long-short-
long pattern, whereas other regions at the same time alternate in a 
short-long-short  pattern.  These  out-of-phase  regions  are  separated 
by a nodal line in which no alternans is present, but spatial gradients 
in  the  action  potential  duration  are  steepest  along  this  line.  Thus 
spatially discordant alternans creates gradients in tissue refractoriness,

which in turn favor the development of reentry by a premature beat 
(Fig. 33-28B). At the cellular level, the steepness of the action potential 
duration  restitution  curve  and  intracellular  calcium  level  ([Ca2+]i) 
dynamics cause the action potential duration and [Ca2+]i transient to 
alternate. Given the bidirectional coupling between changes in [Ca2+]i 
and  membrane  potentialfor  example,  the  membrane  potential 
determines  the  activity  of  L-type  Cav  channels,  and  conversely,  the 
[Ca2+]i  transient  amplitude  strongly  modulates  the  action  potential 
duration  through  its  effects  on  Ca2+-sensitive  currents  (e.g.,  INa/Ca) 
during the action potential plateauan alternation in [Ca2+]i transient 
amplitude can cause a secondary alternation in the action potential 
duration. Indeed, experimental evidence has strongly suggested that 
the onset of APD alternans is primarily attributable to instabilities in 
[Ca2+]i  cycling  dynamics,  thus  defining  a  causal  role  of  intracellular 
Ca2+-handling  abnormalities  in  initiating  electrical  instability.  At  the 
tissue level, alternans combines with instabilities in conduction velocity 
to cause alternans to become spatially discordant. T wave alternans is 
the  electrocardiographic  manifestation  of  action  potential  duration 
[Ca2+]i  alternans  and  thus  is  a  clinical  predictor  of  future  arrhythmic 
events.

In addition to a role of Purkinje fibers in the initiation of VF, other 
studies have suggested involvement of Purkinje fibers in the mainte-
nance of VF, either as part of a reentrant circuit or as a source of focal 
activation. Their role appears to be more important during later (>1 
minute) than during earlier stages of VF.100

Ventricular Tachycardias Caused by  
Nonreentrant Mechanisms
In some cases of ventricular tachycardia related to coronary artery 
disease, especially in patients without coronary artery disease, non-
reentrant mechanisms are important causes of ventricular tachycar-
dias.  However,  in  many  patients  the  mechanism  of  the  ventricular 
tachycardia remains unknown.

Triggered Activity
A group of probably nonreentrant ventricular tachycardias occurring 
in the absence of structural heart disease can be initiated and termi-
nated by programmed stimulation. They are catecholamine depen-
dent  and  can  be  terminated  by  the  Valsalva  maneuver,  adenosine, 
and verapamil. These ventricular tachycardias are generally but not 
exclusively located in the right ventricular outflow tract and may be 
caused  by  triggered  activity,  possibly  DADs  that  are  cAMP  depen-
dent.59  EADs  have  been  recorded  in  this  tachycardia  as  well.  Left 
ventricular fascicular tachycardias can be suppressed by verapamil 
but  not  generally  by  adenosine,  and  some  may  be  caused  by  trig-
gered activity and others by reentry. EADs and triggered activity may 
be responsible for torsades de pointes.

saga of cardiac alternans. Circ Res 98:1244, 2006. By permission of the American

Automaticity
Automatic discharge can be responsible for some ventricular tachy-
cardias and does not appear to be suppressed by adenosine. Unless 
invasive studies are undertaken, mechanisms of ventricular tachycar-
dia can only be conjectured.

Molecular Composition of Ion Channels
Voltage-Gated Na+ Channels
Voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channel pore-forming (alpha) subunits have 
four  homologous  domains  (I  to  IV),  each  of  which  contains  six 
transmembranespanning  regions,  and  these  four  domains  come 
together to form the Na+ permeable pore (see Fig. 33-11).1 Among the 
multiple Nav alpha subunits, Nav1.5 (which is encoded by the SCN5A 
gene) is the prominent Nav alpha subunit expressed in mammalian 
myocardium. The name of the voltage-gated sodium channel consists 
of the chemical symbol of the principal permeating ion (Na) and v, 
which  indicates  its  principal  physiologic  regulator  (voltage).  The 
number  following  v  indicates  the  gene  subfamily  (Nav1),  and  the 
number  following  the  decimal  point  identifies  the  specific  channel 
isoform (e.g., Nav1.1). An identical nomenclature applies to voltage-
gated  calcium  and  potassium  channels.  Mutations  in  the  sequence 
linking domains III and IV in SCN5A, which are associated with LQT3 
syndrome, disrupt Nav channel inactivation and thereby give rise to 
a sustained inward Na+ current during the plateau phase of the action 
potential and to prolongation of the action potential. Cases of sudden 
infant  death  syndrome  in  black  Americans  have  been  linked  to  a 
polymorphism in the SCN5A gene, which encodes a variant cardiac 
sodium  channel  with  diminished  channel  inactivation  in  the  pres-
ence of lowered intracellular pH.2 Mutations in SCN5A are also linked 
to Brugada syndrome. Brugada syndrome mutations result in reduced 
Nav  current  amplitude,  which  leads  to  slowing  of  phase  0  action 
potential upstroke, reduced action potential amplitude, and altered 
phase 1 repolarization.

Nav1.5  pore-forming  alpha  subunits  coassemble  with  one  to  two 
auxiliary Nav beta subunits to form functional cell surface Nav chan-
nels in cardiomyocytes. Nav beta subunits appear to play an impor-
tant  role  in  anchoring  ion  channel  proteins  to  the  outer  cell 
membrane.

Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channels
Like  Nav  channels,  cardiac  voltage-gated  Ca2+  (Cav)  channels  are 
assemblies of a pore-forming alpha subunit and auxiliary Cav beta or 
Cav alpha2-delta subunits (see Fig. 33-11). Among the various alpha 
subunits,  Cav1.2,  encoded  by  the  CACNA1C  gene,  is  the  prominent 
Cav  alpha  subunit  expressed  in  mammalian  myocardium.  Cav1.2 
channels exhibit many of the time- and voltage-dependent properties 
and pharmacologic sensitivities of cardiac L-type Ca2+ currents (see 
Table  33-3).  Accessory  subunits  modulate  the  functional  properties 
of Cav channels.

Cav3.1/alpha1G alpha subunits form a Ca2+-selective channel with 
time- and voltage-dependent characteristics and pharmacologic sen-
sitivities that resemble those of the low-voltage activated T-type Ca2+ 
channel. Disruption of the gene encoding Cav3.1/alpha1G alpha sub-
units (CACNA1G) in mice has been demonstrated to slow the sinus 
node rate and AV conduction, consistent with its role in sinoatrial and 
AV node function.3

Voltage-Gated K+ Channels
Voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) are composed of four separate pore-
forming (alpha) subunits, each containing six regions (S1 through S6) 
of  hydrophobic  amino  acids  that  are  thought  to  form  membrane-
spanning  domains  (see  Fig.  33-11).1  Kv  alpha  subunits  expressed  in 
the human heart include members of the Kv1, Kv4, hERG, and KvLQT 
subfamilies. In addition, Kv channel alpha subunit proteins interact 
with  Kv  channel  accessory  subunits,  including  minK,  KiChIP2,  and 
MiRP1 (see Table 33-3), to form functional cell surface channels with 
distinct time- and voltage-dependent properties. Coassembly of the 
Kv4.3 alpha subunits and the accessory subunit KChIP2 gives rise to 
the  cardiac  transient  outward  Kv  channel  Ito.  ERG1  alpha  subunits, 
together with MiRP1 accessory subunits, contribute to the generation 
of  functional  cardiac  IKr  channels.  Mutations  in  the  gene  encoding 
ERG1  (KCNH2)  have  been  shown  to  underlie  congenital  LQT2 

syndrome.  These  LQT2  syndrome  mutations  are  loss-of-function 
mutations that lead to reduced functional IKr channel expression or 
to alterations in channel processing or trafficking.4

660.e1

KvLQT1 alpha subunits associate with minK accessory subunits to 
form functional channels that resemble slowly activating, noninacti-
vating  K+  currents,  referred  to  as  IKs,  in  human  myocardium.  Muta-
tions  in  the  minK-encoding  gene  KCNE1  are  associated  with  LQT5 
syndrome. Mutations in the gene encoding KvLQT1 alpha subunits, 
KCNQ1, have been linked to LQT1 syndrome. These mutations are all 
loss-of-function mutations that result in reduced expression of func-
tional IKs channels in the outer membrane. Two single-site mutations 
that cause familial AF are located on adjacent amino acid residues 
in the first membrane-spanning segment of KCNQ1 and lead to altered 
physical  interactions  with  the  KCNE1  subunits,  which  ultimately 
results in slowing of deactivation of IKs channels.5

Kv1.5 alpha subunits contribute to K+-selective channels with time- 
and voltage-dependent characteristics that resemble the rapidly acti-
vating  and  slowly  inactivating  IKur  in  human  atrial  myocytes.  IKur 
densities  are  markedly  downregulated  in  the  atria  of  patients  with 
chronic AF.

Small-conductance,  Ca2+-sensitive  K+  channels  are  tetrameric 
assemblies  of  SK  alpha  subunits  and  underlie  a  Ca2+-activated  K+ 
current, IK.Ca, in human cardiomyocytes.6

Inwardly Rectifying Cardiac K+ (Kir) Channels
Kir channels in cardiac myocytes, as in other cells, conduct inward 
current at membrane potentials negative to EK and smaller outward 
currents  at  membrane  potentials  positive  to  EK.  The  activity  of  Kir 
channels is a function of both membrane potential and the extracel-
lular K+ concentration ([K+]o). As [K+]o changes, the channel conducts 
inward current at potentials negative to the new EK, whereas a small 
outward current within a certain potential range positive to the new 
EK  remains.  Inwardly  rectifying  K+  channels  are  formed  by  inward 
rectifier K+ channel pore-forming alpha subunits (see Fig. 33-11). In 
contrast to Kv alpha subunits, Kir alpha subunits have only two (not 
six) transmembrane domains (see Fig. 33-11). Molecular studies have 
provided direct evidence that the alpha subunits of the Kir2 subfamily 
(Kir2.1  and  Kir2.2)  encode  the  strongly  inwardly  rectifying  Kir 
channel IK1 in cardiomyocytes.

In cardiomyocytes, Kir6.2 alpha subunits assemble with sulfonyl-
urea receptor proteins to form K+-selective sarcolemmal IK.ATP chan-
nels. IK.ATP channels are thought to play a pivotal role in myocardial 
ischemia and preconditioning. For example, opening of cardiac sar-
colemmal IK.ATP channels underlies electrocardiographic ST-segment 
elevation  during  acute  myocardial  ischemia.  Drugs  such  as  nicor-
andil and diazoxide open adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ 
channels, whereas sulfonylurea compounds (such as glibenclamide) 
inhibit the activity of IK.ATP.

The  molecular  basis  of  the  acetylcholine-activated  K+  channel 
IK.Ach is a heteromultimer of two inwardly rectifying potassium channel 
subunits,  Kir3.1  and  Kir3.4.  Stimulation  of  IK.Ach  by  vagally  secreted 
acetylcholine decreases spontaneous depolarization in the sinoatrial 
node and slows the velocity of conduction in the AV node. Adenos-
ine,  through  type  1  purinergic  receptormediated  G  protein  activa-
tion,  also  increases  IK.Ach  activity  in  atrial,  sinoatrial  node,  and  AV 
node cells, thus making this compound a treatment of choice for AV 
reentry tachycardia.

Cardiac Pacemaker Channel
Channels underlying the pacemaker (funny) current If of sinoatrial 
myocytes are encoded by the HCN channel gene family. Of the four 
known  HCN  pore-forming  alpha  subunits,  HCN4  is  the  most  highly 
expressed in the mammalian myocardium. A mutation in the human 
HCN4 gene has been linked to familial sinus bradycardia.7
