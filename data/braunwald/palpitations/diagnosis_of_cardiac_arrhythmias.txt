In managing clinical arrhythmias, physicians must evaluate and treat 
the  whole  patient,  not  just  the  rhythm  disturbance.1  Some  arrhyth-
mias are hazardous to the patient, regardless of the clinical setting 
(e.g.,  ventricular  fibrillation  [VF]),  whereas  others  are  hazardous 
because of the clinical setting (e.g., rapidly conducted atrial fibrilla-
tion  [AF]  in  a  patient  with  severe  coronary  artery  stenoses).  Some 
rhythm  abnormalities,  such  as  premature  ventricular  complexes 
(PVCs),  may  be  highly  symptomatic  but  not  associated  with  any 
adverse outcomes, whereas some patients with AF have no symptoms 
at all but may still be at significant risk for stroke. Evaluation of the 
patient begins with a careful history and physical examination and 
should usually progress from the simplest to the most complex test, 
from the least invasive and safest to the most invasive and risky, and 
from  the  least  expensive  out-of-hospital  evaluations  to  those  that 
require hospitalization and sophisticated, costly, and potentially risky 
procedures. On occasion, depending on the clinical circumstances, 
the physician may wish to proceed directly to an expensive proce-
dure associated with some risk, such as an electrophysiologic study 
(EPS), before obtaining a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording. In 
most cases, management of arrhythmia has a dual purpose: evalua-
tion and treatment must address not only the patients symptoms but 
also whatever risks that the arrhythmia poses to the individual.

HISTORY

Patients with disturbances in cardiac rhythm can have various com-
plaints, but symptoms such as palpitations, syncope, presyncope, or 
dyspnea  commonly  cause  them  to  seek  a  physicians  help.  Their 
awareness of palpitations and a regular or irregular cardiac rhythm 
varies greatly. Some patients perceive slight variations in their heart 
rhythm  with  uncommon  accuracy,  whereas  others  are  oblivious  to 
even sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT); still others 
complain  of  palpitations  when  they  actually  have  regular  sinus 
rhythm.

In  assessing  a  patient  with  a  known  or  suspected  arrhythmia, 
several key pieces of information should be obtained that can help 
determine a diagnosis or guide further diagnostic testing. The mode 
of onset of an episode may provide clues about the type of arrhythmia 
or  preferred  treatment  option.  For  example,  palpitations  that  occur 
in  the  setting  of  exercise,  fright,  or  anger  are  often  caused  by 
catecholamine-sensitive  automatic  or  triggered  tachycardias  that 
may respond to adrenergic blocking agents (see Chapter 35); palpi-
tations that occur at rest or that awaken the patient may be caused 
by  vagal  initiation,  such  as  AF.  Lightheadedness  or  syncope  occur-
ring in the setting of a tightly fitting collar, shaving the neck, or turning 
the head suggests carotid sinus hypersensitivity. The triggering event 

may help establish the presence of an inherited ion channel abnor-
mality (see Chapter 32). The mode of termination of episodes can 
also  be  helpful:  palpitations  that  are  reliably  terminated  by  breath-
holding or by Valsalva or other vagal maneuvers probably involve the 
atrioventricular (AV) node as an integral part of a tachycardia circuit; 
on occasion, focal atrial tachycardias or VTs can be terminated with 
vagal maneuvers. Patients should be asked about the frequency and 
duration of episodes and the severity of symptoms. In some women 
the  features  of  their  episodes  vary  according  to  the  menstrual  
cycle. These features can help guide how aggressively and quickly 
the  physician  needs  to  pursue  a  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  plan  (a 
patient with daily episodes associated with near-syncope or severe 
dyspnea warrants a more expeditious evaluation than does one with 
infrequent  episodes  of  mild  palpitations  and  no  other  symptoms). 
Patients  can  sometimes  report  their  heart  rate  during  an  episode 
(either  rapid  or  slow,  regular  or  irregular)  by  counting  the  pulse 
directly or by using an automatic blood pressure or heart rate monitor 
or  smart  phone  application.  Characteristics  of  the  mode  of  onset  
and frequency of episodes can guide the choice of diagnostic tests 
(see later).

A  careful  drug  and  dietary  history  should  also  be  sought;  some 
nasal  decongestants  can  provoke  tachycardia  episodes,  whereas 
beta-adrenergic  blocking  eye  drops  for  the  treatment  of  glaucoma 
can drain into tear ducts, be absorbed systemically, and precipitate 
syncope secondary to bradycardia. Dietary supplements, particularly 
those  containing  stimulants  such  as  ephedrine,  can  cause  arrhyth-
mias. A growing list of drugs can directly or indirectly affect ventricu-
lar repolarization and produce or exacerbate longQT intervalrelated 
tachyarrhythmias (see Chapter 9; see also www.crediblemeds.org). 
The  patient  should  be  questioned  about  the  presence  of  systemic 
illnesses that may be associated with arrhythmias, such as chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  thyrotoxicosis  (see  Chapter  81), 
pericarditis (see Chapter 71), and chronic heart failure (see Chap-
ters 24 and 25), as well as previous chest injury, surgery, or radiation 
therapy or chemotherapy. A family history of rhythm disturbances is 
often present in those with long-QT syndrome, AF or other inherited 
arrhythmia syndromes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Chapter 
66), and muscular or myotonic dystrophy (see Chapter 87).

PHYSICALEXAMINATION

Examination of a patient during an arrhythmia episode can be reveal-
ing.  Heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  should  be  evaluated,  as  well  as 
how ill the person appears. Assessment of jugular venous pressure 
and waveform can disclose the rapid oscillations of atrial flutter or 
cannon A waves indicative of contraction of the right atrium against

a closed tricuspid valve in patients with AV dissociation in disorders 
such as complete heart block or VT. Variations in the intensity of the 
first  heart  sound  and  systolic  blood  pressure  have  the  same 
implications.

Physical  maneuvers  during  tachycardia  can  have  diagnostic  and 
therapeutic  value.  As  noted,  the  Valsalva  maneuver2  (as  well  as 
carotid  sinus  massage)  causes  a  transient  increase  in  vagal  tone; 
tachyarrhythmias that depend on the AV node for continuation can 
terminate  or  slow  with  these  maneuvers  but  may  also  show  no 
change. Even though focal atrial and VTs occasionally terminate in 
response  to  vagal  stimulation,  sinus  tachycardia  slows  slightly  but 
returns  to  its  original  rate  soon  thereafter;  the  ventricular  response 
during atrial flutter and fibrillation and other atrial tachycardias can 
decrease  briefly.  During  wide-QRS  tachycardias  with  a  1:1  relation-
ship  between  P  waves  and  QRS  complexes,  vagal  influence  can 
terminate or slow a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that depends 
on  the  AV  node  for  perpetuation;  on  the  other  hand,  vagal  effects 
on  the  AV  node  can  transiently  block  retrograde  conduction  and 
thus  establish  the  diagnosis  of  VT  by  demonstrating  AV  dissocia-
tion. Because the effect of either of these physical maneuvers typi-
cally  lasts  only  seconds,  clinicians  must  be  ready  to  observe  or 
record  any  changes  in  rhythm  on  an  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
when  the  maneuver  is  performed  or  the  response  may  not  be 
appreciated.

Carotid  massage  is  performed  with  the  patient  supine  and  com-
fortable  and  the  head  tipped  away  from  the  side  being  stimulated. 
Careful  auscultation  for  carotid  bruits  must  always  precede  any 
attempt  at  carotid  massage  (embolic  events  have  been  associated 
with massage3). The area of the carotid sinus, at the arterys bifurca-
tion, is palpated with two fingers at the angle of the jaw until a good 
pulse  is  felt.  Even  this  minimal  amount  of  pressure  can  induce  a 
hypersensitive response in susceptible individuals. If no initial effect 
is noted, a side-to-side or rotating motion of the fingers over the site 
is  performed  for  up  to  5  seconds.  A  negative  response  is  lack  of 
effect on the ECG after 5 seconds of pressure adequate to cause mild 
discomfort. Because responses to carotid massage may differ on the 
two  sides,  the  maneuver  can  be  repeated  on  the  opposite  side; 
however,  both  sides  should  never  be  stimulated  simultaneously. 
Findings may not be readily reproducible, even within minutes of a 
prior attempt.

Physical  findings  can  suggest  the  presence  of  structural  heart 
disease (and thus generally a clinically more serious situation with a 
worse  overall  prognosis),  even  in  the  absence  of  an  arrhythmia 
episode.  For  example,  a  laterally  displaced  or  dyskinetic  apical 
impulse, a regurgitant or stenotic murmur, or a third heart sound in 
an older adult can denote significant myocardial or valvular dysfunc-
tion or damage.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

The ECG is the primary tool for analysis of arrhythmias (see Chapter 
12); an EPS, in which intracardiac catheters are used to record activ-
ity from several regions of the heart at one time, is more definitive 
but  not  always  immediately  available.  Initially,  a  12-lead  ECG  is 
recorded.  In  addition,  a  long  continuous  recording  with  use  of  the 
lead that shows distinct P waves is often helpful for closer analysis; 
typically, this is one of the inferior leads (2, 3, aVF), V1, or aVR. The 
ECG  obtained  during  an  arrhythmia  episode  may  be  diagnostic  by 
itself and obviate the need for further diagnostic testing. Figure 34-1 
depicts an algorithm for the diagnosis of specific tachyarrhythmias 
from the 12-lead ECG (see Chapter 37). A major branch point in the 
differential  diagnosis  concerns  the  QRS  duration:  wide-QRS  (>0.12 
second) tachycardias are often VTs, and narrow-QRS (0.12 second) 
tachycardias  are  almost  always  SVTs,  but  there  is  some  overlap 
(Table 34-1). Next, the most important questions to answer, regard-
less of QRS width, concern the characteristics of P waves. If P waves 
are not clearly visible on the regular ECG, atrial activity can occasion-
ally be discerned by placing the right and left arm leads in various 
anterior  chest  positions  (so-called  Lewis  leads),  by  recording  atrial

electrograms  using  intracardiac  right  atrial  recordings  (via  perma-
nent or temporary transvenous pacing leads), or by using esophageal 
electrodes  or  an  echocardiogram;  the  last  methods  are  not  readily 
available in most clinical situations and consume valuable time when 
dealing  with  a  sick  patient.  A  long  rhythm  strip  can  usually  be 
obtained and may yield important clues by revealing P waves if per-
turbations occur during the arrhythmia (e.g., changes in rate, prema-
ture complexes, sudden termination, and effect of physical maneuvers, 
as noted earlier).

Each arrhythmia should be approached in a systematic manner to 
answer  several  key  questions;  as  suggested  earlier,  many  of  these 
questions relate to P wave characteristics and underscore the impor-
tance of assessing the ECG carefully for them. If P waves are visible, 
are  the  atrial  and  ventricular  rates  identical?  Are  the  P-P  and  R-R 
intervals regular or irregular? If irregular, is it a consistent, repeating 
irregularity? Is there a P wave related to each QRS complex? Does the 
P wave seem to precede (long RP interval) or follow (short RP inter-
val)  the  QRS  complex  (Fig.  34-2)?  Are  the  resultant  RP  and  PR 
intervals constant? Are all P waves and QRS complexes identical? Is 
the P wave vector normal or abnormal? Are P, PR, QRS, and QT dura-
tions normal? Once these questions have been addressed, one needs 
to  assess  the  significance  of  the  arrhythmia  in  view  of  the  clinical 
setting. Should it be treated, and if so, how? For SVTs with a normal 
QRS complex, a branching decision tree such as that shown in Figure 
34-1 may be useful.4

cardiac  structures  (Fig.  34-3).  Because  the  ECG  and  therefore  the 
ladder diagram represent electrical activity against a time base, con-
duction is indicated by the lines of the ladder diagram sloping in a 
left-to-right direction. A steep line represents rapid conduction; more 
slanting lines depict slower conduction. A short bar drawn perpen-
dicular to a sloping line represents blocked conduction. Activity origi-
nating  in  an  ectopic  site  such  as  the  ventricle  is  indicated  by  lines 
emanating from that tier. Sinus nodal discharge and conduction and, 
under  certain  circumstances,  AV  junctional  discharge  and  conduc-
tion  can  only  be  inferred;  their  activity  is  not  directly  recorded  on  
the ECG.

ADDITIONALTESTS

Most  patients  have  only  occasional  episodes  of  arrhythmia  and 
spend most of the time in their baseline rhythm (e.g., sinus, AF). The 
ECG during the patients resting rhythm can provide clues about the 
presence of a substrate for arrhythmia (i.e., structural or physiologic 
abnormalities  from  which  arrhythmias  can  arise).  Several  of  these 
abnormalities  are  shown  in  Figure  34-4.  Recently,  the  common 
finding on the ECG of early repolarization (in the lateral precordial 
and inferior leads) has been observed in some patients with primary 
VF (i.e., without identifiable structural heart disease). In most patients

bundle regions, and right ventricle. B, The same beat is shown with the accompanying ladder diagram below. Cardiac regions have been divided into tiers separated by horizontal 
lines. Vertical dotted lines denote onset of the P wave and QRS complexes. Note the relatively steep lines (rapid conduction through the atrium, His bundle, and ventricular mus-
cle) and more gently sloping lines as the impulse traverses the sinus and AV nodes (signifying slow conduction). C, Several different situations are depicted with accompanying 
explanatory ladder diagrams. Beat 1 is normal, as in B; beat 2 shows first-degree AV delay, with the more gradual slope than normal in the AV nodal tier signifying very slow 
conduction in this region. In beat 3, an atrial premature complex is shown (starting in the atrial tier at the asterisk) and is producing an inverted P wave on the ECG. In beat 4, 
an ectopic impulse arises in the His bundle (asterisk) and propagates to the ventricle, as well as retrogradely through the AV node to the atrium. In beat 5, a ventricular ectopic 
complex (asterisk) conducts retrogradely through the His bundle and AV node and eventually to the atrium. D, A Wenckebach AV cycle (type I second-degree block) is shown. As 
the PR interval progressively increases from left to right in the figure, the slope of the line in the AV nodal region is progressively less steep until it fails to propagate at all after the 
fourth P wave (small line perpendicular to the sloping AV nodal conduction line), after which the cycle repeats. A = atrial recording; H = His recording; V = ventricular recording.

with  SVT  (aside  from  those  with  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome), 
findings  on  the  resting  ECG  are  normal.  This  is  also  true  for  many 
patients  with  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias.  Thus  although  it  is 
capable of showing an abnormality with possible arrhythmic impli-
cations, the resting ECG is not a very sensitive tool. In light of this, 
the following additional tests can be used to evaluate patients who 
have cardiac arrhythmias. The physicians choice of which test to use 
depends on the clinical circumstances. For example, a patient with 
multiple  daily  episodes  of  presyncope  is  likely  to  have  an  event 
recorded  on  a  24-hour  ambulatory  electrocardiographic  (Holter) 
monitor, whereas in a patient who complains of infrequent exercise-
induced  palpitations,  exercise  stress  testing  may  be  more  likely  to 
provide a diagnosis.

ExerciseTesting
Exercise can induce various types of supraventricular and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias and, uncommonly, bradyarrhythmias (see Chapter 
13). Ventricular ectopy develops in approximately a third of normal 
subjects in response to exercise testing. Ectopy is more likely to occur 
at faster heart rates, usually in the form of occasional PVCs of con-
stant morphology or even pairs of PVCs, and is often not reproducible 
from one stress test to the next. Three to six beats of nonsustained 
VT can occur in normal patients, especially the elderly, and its occur-
rence does not establish the existence of ischemic or other forms of 
heart disease or predict increased cardiovascular morbidity or mor-
tality. PVCs are often more common during exercise than at rest and 
increase in frequency with age; their occurrence does not imply the 
presence of structural heart disease. A persistent elevation in heart 
rate after the end of exercise (delay in return to baseline) is associ-
ated with a worse cardiovascular prognosis.

PVCs  develop  in  approximately  50%  of  patients  with  coronary 
artery  disease  in  response  to  exercise  testing.  Ventricular  ectopy 
appears in these patients at lower heart rates (<130 beats/min) than 
in  the  normal  population  and  often  occurs  in  the  early  recovery 
period as well. Frequent (>7 PVCs/min) or complex ectopy is associ-
ated with a worse prognosis. Exercise reproduces sustained VT or VF 
in  less  than  10%  of  patients  with  spontaneous  VT  or  VF  late  after 
myocardial  infarction,  and  these  patients  have  a  worse  prognosis. 
The relationship of exercise to ventricular arrhythmia in patients with 
structurally normal hearts has no prognostic implications.

Patients  who  have  symptoms  consistent  with  an  arrhythmia 
induced by exercise (e.g., syncope, sustained palpitations) should be 
considered  for  stress  testing.  Stress  testing  may  be  indicated  to 
provoke supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, to determine 

the relationship of the arrhythmia to activity, to aid in choosing antiar-
rhythmic therapy and uncovering proarrhythmic responses, and pos-
sibly to provide some insight into the mechanism of the tachycardia. 
The  test  can  be  performed  safely;  however,  prolonged  ambulatory 
recording  is  more  sensitive  than  exercise  testing  in  detecting  most 
arrhythmias. Because either technique can uncover serious arrhyth-
mias  that  the  other  technique  misses,  both  examinations  may  be 
indicated for selected patients. Stress testing is frequently useful in 
patients  with  long-QT  syndrome  and  catecholaminergic  VT  (see 
Chapters 13 and 32).5

In-HospitalElectrocardiographicRecording
Electrocardiographic monitoring systems are used in increasing pro-
portions  of  inpatients  regardless  of  history  or  suspicion  of  arrhyth-
mias. These systems can provide valuable information about rhythm 
abnormalities, including mode of onset and termination, and allow 
prompt  acquisition  of  a  full  12-lead  ECG  for  more  detail.  Telemetry 
may disclose intermittent heart block in a patient with presyncope 
that may warrant consideration of pacemaker implantation or reveal 
nonsustained VT in a patient with previous myocardial infarction and 
left  ventricular  dysfunction  and  prompt  an  electrophysiology  study 
for further assessment of risk. As often as telemetry is helpful in such 
cases, however, it can be misleading: artifact can simulate VT or VF, 
heart block, or asystole. Careful scrutiny is necessary to avoid unnec-
essary tests and procedures in patients with these artifactual arrhyth-
mias (Fig. 34-5; real and artifact on monitor).

Long-TermElectrocardiographicRecording
Prolonged  electrocardiographic  recording  in  patients  engaged  in 
normal  daily  activities  is  the  most  useful  noninvasive  method  to 
document and quantitate the frequency and complexity of an arrhyth-
mia, to correlate the arrhythmia with the patients symptoms, and to 
evaluate the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy on spontaneous arrhyth-
mia. For example, recording normal sinus rhythm during the patients 
typical symptomatic episode effectively excludes cardiac arrhythmia 
as a cause. In addition, some recorders can document alterations in 
QRS, ST, and T contours.

Ambulatory Electrocardiographic (Holter) Recording
Continuous electrocardiographic tape recorders represent the tradi-
tional Holter monitor and digitally record three or more electrocar-
diographic channels for 24 to 48 hours. Computers scan the recording 
media,  with  human  oversight,  to  provide  a  report  with  snapshot

failure. After the first five paced complexes, the ECG is flat in both monitor leads, thus suggesting failure of pacemaker

recordings  of  symptomatic  events  and  other  important  findings 
(asymptomatic  arrhythmias,  ST-segment  changes).  All  systems  can 
potentially record more information than the physician needs or can 
assimilate.  As  long  as  the  system  detects  important  episodes  of 
ectopic activity, VT, or asystolic intervals and semiquantitates these 
abnormalities, the physician probably receives all the clinical infor-
mation that is needed. Twenty-five percent to 50% of patients experi-
ence  a  complaint  during  a  24-hour  recording;  in  2%  to  15%  the 
complaint is caused by an arrhythmia (Fig. 34-6). The ability to cor-
relate symptoms temporally with abnormalities on the ECG is one of 
the strengths of this technique.

Significant rhythm disturbances are uncommon in healthy young 
persons.  Sinus  bradycardia  with  heart  rates  of  35  to  40  beats/min, 
sinus  arrhythmia  with  pauses  exceeding  3  seconds,  sinoatrial  exit 
block,  type  I  (Wenckebach)  second-degree  AV  block  (often  during 
sleep),  wandering  atrial  pacemaker,  junctional  escape  complexes, 
and premature atrial complexes and PVCs can be observed and are 
not necessarily abnormal. Frequent and complex atrial and ventricu-
lar rhythm disturbances are less commonly observed, however, and 
type II second-degree AV conduction disturbances (see Chapter 37) 
are not recorded in normal patients. Elderly patients (see Chapter 
76) have a higher prevalence of arrhythmias, some of which may be 
responsible  for  neurologic  symptoms  (Fig.  34-7;  also  see  Chapter

tomatic  healthy  subjects  with  frequent 
and complex PVCs usually resembles that 
of the healthy U.S. population, without an 
increased  risk  for  death.  However,  fre-
quent  PVCs  (>15%  of  the  total)  have 
recently  been  shown  to  produce  cardio-
myopathy  and  heart  failure 
in  some 
people, which can be reversed following 
elimination of the PVCs.
Most  patients  with 

ischemic  heart 
disease,  particularly  after  myocardial 
infarction  (see  Chapters  51  and  52), 
exhibit PVCs when they are monitored for 
24  hours.  The  frequency  of  PVCs  progres-
sively  increases  during  the  first  several 
weeks  and  then  decreases  at  about  6 
months  after 
infarction.  Frequent  and 
complex  PVCs  are  associated  with  a 
twofold 
for 
cardiac  or  sudden  death  in  patients  after 
myocardial  infarction,  but  treating  these 
PVCs may not improve the prognosis. CAST 
(Cardiac  Arrhythmia  Suppression  Trial) 
showed  that  PVCs  identified  patients  at 
increased  risk  for  sudden  death  but  that 
successful  suppression  of  PVCs  with  fle-
cainide,  encainide,  or  moricizine  was  
associated  with  increased  mortality  in 
comparison 
to  placebo.  Recent  data  
indicate that ablation of PVCs after myocar-
dial  infarction  may  improve  previously 
depressed ventricular function.

Long-term  recording  of  the  ECG  has 
also  exposed  potentially  serious  arrhyth-
mias  and  complex  ventricular  ectopy  in 
patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, 
as  well  as  in  those  with  hypertrophic, 
dilated, and ischemic cardiomyopathy; in 
those  with  mitral  valve  prolapse  (see 
Chapter  63);  in  those  with  otherwise 
unexplained  syncope  (see  Chapter  40) 
or transient vague cerebrovascular symp-
toms; and in those with conduction distur-
bances, 
dysfunction, 
bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome (see Chapter 
37),  and  pacemaker  malfunction  (see  Chapter  36).  It  has  been 
shown that asymptomatic AF occurs far more often than symptomatic 
episodes in patients with AF.

Variations of Holter recording have been used for particular appli-
cations.  Some  monitoring  systems  are  able  to  reconstruct  a  full 
12-lead ECG from a 7-electrode recording system. This is especially 
useful  in  trying  to  document  the  electrocardiographic  morphology 
of  VT  before  an  ablation  procedure  or  a  consistent  morphology  of 
PVCs that may arise from an ablatable focus of VT or VF. Most Holter 
recording  and  analysis  systems  can  place  a  clearly  recognizable 
deflection on the recording when a pacemaker stimulus is detected. 
This greatly facilitates diagnosis of potential pacemaker malfunction. 
On  occasion,  artifacts  on  the  ECG  caused  by  alterations  in  tape 
recording or playback speed can mimic bradycardias or tachycardias 
and lead to erroneous therapy. Newer digital Holter systems are less 
subject to this phenomenon. Finally, most systems can also provide 
heart rate variability and QT data (see later). Use of these systems for 
detection of myocardial ischemia (ST-segment analysis) has yielded 
mixed results (in both specificity and sensitivity).

Event Recording
In many patients, the 24- or 48-hour snapshot provided by the Holter 
recording  is  incapable  of  documenting  the  cause  of  the  patients

than if the patient had to schedule an

Implantable Loop Recorder
For patients with very infrequent symp-
toms,  neither  Holter  recorders  nor 
30-day event recorders may yield diag-
nostic  information.  In  such  patients, 
an implantable loop recorder may be 
used. This device (about the size of a 
pack  of  chewing  gum)  is  inserted 
under the skin at about the second rib 
on the left front aspect of the chest and 
is  activated  by  passing  a  special 
magnet over the device. It is capable 
of  recording  up  to  42  minutes  of  a 
single channel of the ECG that can be 
partitioned for one to seven episodes, 
with up to 20 minutes of the preactiva-
tion  ECG  being  saved  for  subsequent 
downloading  to  a  programming  unit 
for  analysis.  Both  P  waves  and  QRS 
complexes  can  usually  be  identified. 
The device can be configured to store 
patient-activated  episodes,  automati-
cally activated recordings (heart rate 
outside preset parameters), or a com-
bination  of  these.  In  one  report  of 
patients with unexplained syncope, a 
diagnosis  was  ultimately  made  in  80%  by  long-term  monitoring,  in 
26% of them after 18 months of monitoring.8

FIGURE34-7  Continuous electrocardiographic recording from a patient-activated event monitor during an episode of

symptoms. Longer-term monitoring, such as with an event recorder, 
is necessary in these cases, which occur frequently. These devices 
are about the size of a pager and are kept by the patient for 30 days. 
During that time, digital recordings can be made during symptomatic 
episodes  and  be  transmitted  to  a  receiving  station  over  standard 
telephone lines at the patients convenience (see Fig. 34-7). Some of 
these  recorders  store  more  than  30  seconds  of  the  ECG  before  the 
patient activates the recording. These loop recorders record continu-
ously, but only a small window of time is present in memory at any 
moment; when the event button is pressed by the patient, the current 
window is frozen while the device continues recording for another 
30 to 60 seconds, depending on how it is configured. Event recorders 
are highly effective in documenting infrequent events, but the quality 
of the recordings is more subject to motion artifact than with Holter 
recorders, and usually only one channel can be recorded. With some 
systems the patient must be able to press the event button to begin 
recording; if syncope occurs without warning and the patient is not 
able to actuate the device, it cannot provide diagnostic information. 
With  other  systems,  the  device  automatically  begins  recording  the 
rhythm  when  the  heart  rate  increases  or  decreases  outside  preset 
parameters.  Some  systems  incorporate  cell  phone  technology  that 
automatically notifies a central monitoring facility when certain con-
ditions are met (e.g., extreme bradycardia or tachycardia). In this way 
the  time  between  occurrence  and  effective  treatment  of  serious 
arrhythmias can be significantly shortened.6

A  variety  of  additional  noninvasive  tests  have  been  developed 
primarily to assess the risk for arrhythmic death in different groups 
of patients; although each has some applicability, none has enjoyed 
widespread  use  because  of  suboptimal  sensitivity  and  specificity. 
Several of these tests are discussed in the following sections.

Heart Rate Variability
Heart rate variability is used to evaluate vagal and sympathetic influ-
ences on the sinus node (inferring that the same activity is also occur-
ring in the ventricles) and to identify patients at risk for a cardiovascular 
event or death.9 Frequency domain analysis resolves parasympathetic 
and  sympathetic  influences  better  than  time  domain  analysis  does, 
but both types of analysis are useful. R-R variability predicts all-cause 
mortality, as well as left ventricular ejection fraction or nonsustained 
VT  in  patients  after  myocardial  infarction,  and  can  be  added  to   
other measures of risk to enhance predictive accuracy. Similar results 
have  been  obtained  in  patients  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  (see 
Chapters  25  and  65).  High-frequency  components  of  R-R  interval 
variability reflect tonic vagal activity. Reduced R-R interval variability, 
a marker of increased risk, indicates loss or reduction of the physio-
logic  periodic  sinus  node  fluctuations,  which  has  many  potential 
causes and may not necessarily represent a significant shift in auto-
nomic modulation. New indices of heart rate variability are continually 
being  evaluated.  Even  the  simple  measure  of  resting  heart  rate  has 
been shown to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor, although

a target safe heart rate has not been established, as has the heart 
rate obtained during and after exercise.

Heart Rate Turbulence
Heart  rate  turbulence  is  an  index  of  changes  in  the  sinus  discharge 
rate after a PVC that is followed by a compensatory pause.10 In normal 
individuals,  the  sinus  rate  initially  accelerates  and  then  slows;  this 
phenomenon is blunted or absent in patients with various heart dis-
eases.  Heart  rate  turbulence  is  a  measure  of  reflex  vagal  control  of 
the heart, whereas heart rate variability is more indicative of overall 
vagal tone. Abnormal heart rate turbulence is a strong independent 
predictor  of  mortality  in  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  and 
dilated  cardiomyopathy;  abnormal  indices  in  some  patients  can  be 
improved or normalized after treatment with beta blockers and statin 
drugs.

QT Dispersion
Heterogeneity in refractoriness and conduction velocity is a hallmark 
of reentrant arrhythmias. One index of the heterogeneity of ventricu-
lar refractoriness can be found in differences in the length of the QT 
interval on surface leads of the ECG. The index most commonly used 
to calculate this QT dispersion has been the difference between the 
longest and shortest QT intervals on the 12-lead ECG, which is often 
adjusted for heart rate and the number of leads sampled (when the 
T  wave  is  flat  in  some).  Other  indices  have  also  been  developed. 
Abnormally  high  QT  dispersion  has  been  correlated  with  risk  for 
arrhythmic  death  in  patients  with  various  disorders,  although  the 
results  are  not  consistent.  Its  mechanism  has  been  characterized  in 
several  disease  states.  QT  dispersion  has  been  correlated  with  both 
efficacy  and  the  proarrhythmic  potential  of  drug  therapy.  Different 
techniques  exist  for  determining  dispersion  (including  automated 
algorithms), and the results of one study are often difficult to compare 
with those of another; in addition, the test is sensitive to age, time of 
day, season of year, and even body position.11 Overall, assessment of 
QT dispersion has not gained popularity as a useful clinical tool.

Signal-Averaged Electrocardiography and Late Potentials
Signal averaging is a method that improves the signal-to-noise ratio 
when the signals are recurrent and the noise is random. In conjunction 
with appropriate filtering and other methods of noise reduction, signal 
averaging can detect cardiac signals of a few microvolts in amplitude 
and  reduce  noise  amplitude,  such  as  muscle  potentials,  which  are 
typically 5 to 25 mV, to less than 1 mV. With this method, very low-
amplitude electrical potentials generated by the sinus and AV nodes, 
His bundle, and bundle branches are detectable at the body surface.
One  constituent  of  reentrant  ventricular  arrhythmias  in  patients 
with previous myocardial damage is slow conduction. Direct cardiac 
mapping  techniques  can  record  the  myocardial  activation  from 
damaged areas that occurs after the end of the surface electrocardio-
graphic QRS complex during sinus rhythm. These delayed signals have 
a very low amplitude that cannot be discerned by routine electrocar-
diography and correspond to the delayed and fragmented conduction 
in the ventricles recorded with direct mapping techniques (Fig. e34-1). 
Signal averaging has been applied clinically most often to detect such 
late ventricular potentials of 1 to 25 mV. Criteria for late potentials are 
the  following:  (1)  filtered  QRS  complex  duration  longer  than  114  to 
120 milliseconds, (2) less than 20 mV of the root mean square signal 
amplitude in the last 40 milliseconds of the filtered QRS complex, and 
(3) terminal filtered QRS complex remaining below 40 mV for longer 
than 39 milliseconds. Such late potentials have been recorded in more 
than 70% of patients with spontaneous sustained and inducible VT 
after myocardial infarction but in only 0% to 6% of normal volunteers. 
Late potentials can be detected as early as 3 hours after the onset of 
coronary artery occlusion, increase in prevalence in the first week after 
myocardial infarction, and disappear in some patients after 1 year. If 
they are not present initially, late potentials do not usually appear later. 
Patients  with  bundle  branch  block  or  paced  ventricular  rhythms 
already have wide QRS complexes, thus rendering the technique less 
useful in these cases.

Late  potentials  have  also  been  recorded  in  patients  with  VT  not 
related to ischemia, such as in those with dilated cardiomyopathy. The 
presence  of  a  late  potential  is  a  sensitive  but  not  specific  marker  of 
arrhythmic risk, and therefore its prognostic use is limited. In specific 
situations  it  can  be  helpful,  for  example,  in  a  patient  suspected  of 
having arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy12 or a patient 
with  a  previous  inferior  wall  myocardial  infarction  (normally  the  last 
portion of the heart to be activated), in whom the absence of a late 
potential suggests very low risk of having VT episodes.

669

The  high-pass  filtering  used  to  record  late  potentials  meeting  the 
criteria  just  noted  is  called  time  domain  analysis  because  the  filter 
output corresponds in time to the input signal. Because late potentials 
are high-frequency signals, Fourier transform can be applied to extract 
high-frequency  content  from  the  signal-averaged  ECG,  called  fre-
quency domain analysis. Some data suggest that frequency domain 
analysis  provides  useful  information  not  available  with  time  domain 
analysis.

Signal averaging has been applied to the P wave to determine risk 
for  the  development  of  AF  (especially  after  cardiac  surgery),  as  well 
as  maintenance  of  sinus  rhythm  after  cardioversion.13  Overall  use  of 
the technique remains limited at present.

TWaveAlternans
Beat-to-beat alternation in the amplitude or morphology of the elec-
trocardiographic  recording  of  ventricular  repolarization,  the  ST 
segment  and  T  wave,  has  been  found  in  conditions  favoring  the 
development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as ischemia and 
long-QT syndrome, and in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. The 
electrophysiologic basis appears to be the alternation of repolariza-
tion of ventricular myocytes. In the presence of a long QT interval, 
the  cellular  basis  of  alternation  may  be  beat-to-beat  repolarization 
changes  in  midmyocardial  cells  (so-called  M  cells).  Whether  this 
mechanism applies to different disease states is not known. T wave 
alternans testing requires exercise or atrial pacing to achieve a heart 
rate of 100 to 120 beats/min with relatively little atrial or ventricular 
ectopic  activity.  The  test  is  less  useful  in  patients  with  a  wide  QRS 
complex (>120 milliseconds). A positive T wave alternans test result 
(Fig. e34-2) has been associated with a worse arrhythmic prognosis 
in various disorders, including ischemic heart disease and nonisch-
emic cardiomyopathy. Although the predictive value of a positive test 
result varies greatly, depending on the population studied, a negative 
test  result  strongly  predicts  freedom  from  VT  and  VF  in  all  group 
studied  thus  far,  at  least  during  a  short  follow-up  period.  Thus  the 
tests best application appears to be in patients whose arrhythmic risk 
is equivocal, in whom a negative T wave alternans test result suggests 
low risk for the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhyth-
mias. T wave alternans testing alone has not helped segregate patients 
more  likely  to  benefit  from  implantable  cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD) use (positive test result) from those who are not (negative test 
result) and should therefore not undergo ICD implantation. Both fre-
quency  domain  (spectral  method)  and  time  domain  (modified 
moving  average)  analyses  have  usefulness  in  risk  stratification.  T 
wave  alternans  may  represent  a  fundamental  marker  of  an  electri-
cally  unstable  myocardium  prone  to  the  development  of  VT  or  VF, 
but  because  of  its  relatively  minor  incremental  value  in  defining 
arrhythmic risk, it is not frequently used at present.14

Baroreceptor Reflex Sensitivity Testing
Acute  blood  pressure  elevation  triggers  a  baroreceptor  reflex  that 
augments  vagal  tone  to  the  heart  and  slows  the  sinus  rate.  The 
increase in sinus cycle length per millimeter mercury increase in sys-
tolic blood pressure is a measure of the sensitivity of the baroreceptor 
reflex and, when reduced, identifies patients susceptible to the devel-
opment of VT and VF. The mechanism of the reduction in barorecep-
tor reflex sensitivity is not certain. However, this test may be useful to 
identify patients at risk for the development of a serious ventricular 
arrhythmia after myocardial infarction.

Body Surface Mapping
Isopotential body surface maps are used to provide a complete picture 
of  the  effects  of  currents  from  the  heart  on  the  body  surface.  The 
potential distributions are represented by contour lines of equal poten-
tial, and each distribution is displayed instant by instant throughout 
activation, recovery, or both.

Body  surface  maps  have  been  used  clinically  to  localize  and  size 
areas  of  myocardial  ischemia,  to  localize  ectopic  foci  or  accessory 
pathways, to differentiate aberrant supraventricular conduction from 
ventricular origin, to recognize patients at risk for the development of 
arrhythmias,  and  possibly  to  understand  the  mechanisms  involved. 
Although these procedures are of interest, their clinical usefulness has 
not yet been established. In addition, the technique is cumbersome 
and the analysis is complex.

Electrocardiographic Imaging
Another  promising  technology  is  electrocardiographic  imaging,  in 
which cardiac electrical activity recorded at the skin surface is spatially 
integrated with imaging data (currently, cardiac computed tomogra-
phy  scanning).  Using  complex  mathematical  processing  of  electrical 
data collected from 224 electrodes on the skin surface, this technique 
can plot or project atrial and ventricular electrical activity on an epi-
cardial  shell  of  the  patients  own  heart  and  thereby  follow  the 
course  of  activation  during  sinus  rhythm  or  an  arrhythmia.  Clinical 
experience is limited thus far, but both SVTs and VTs have been able 
to be localized in a variety of settings.15

UprightTilt-TableTesting
The tilt-table test is used to identify patients who have a vasodepressor 
or cardioinhibitory response as a cause of syncope (see Chapter 40). 
Patients  are  placed  on  a  tilt  table  in  the  supine  position  and  tilted 
upright to a maximum of 60 to 80 degrees for 20 to 45 minutes or longer 
if  necessary  (Fig.  e34-3).  Isoproterenol,  administered  as  a  bolus  or 
infusion,  may  provoke  syncope  in  patients  whose  initial  upright  tilt-
table test result shows no abnormalities or, after a few minutes of tilt, 
may shorten the time needed to produce a positive response on the 
test.  An  initial  intravenous  isoproterenol  dose  of  1 µg/min  can  be 
increased in 0.5-µg/min steps until symptoms occur or a maximum of 
4 µg/min is given. Isoproterenol induces a vasodepressor response in 
upright susceptible patients (decrease in heart rate and blood pres-
sure  along  with  near-syncope  or  syncope).  Tilt-table  test  results  are 
positive in two thirds to three fourths of patients susceptible to neu-
rally  mediated  syncope  and  are  reproducible  in  approximately  80% 
but have a 10% to 15% false-positive response rate. A positive test result 
is more meaningful when it reproduces symptoms that have occurred 
spontaneously.  Positive  responses  can  be  divided  into  cardioinhibi-
tory, vasodepressor, and mixed categories. Therapy with beta block-
ers,  disopyramide, 
reuptake 
inhibitors,  midodrine,  fludrocortisone,  salt  loading,  and  thigh-high 
support stockings, alone or in combination, has been reported to be 
successful but not with reliable reproducibility. Tilt training, in which 
the patient leans against a wall for prolonged periods to increase toler-
ance to this body position, as well as isometric muscle flexing to abort 
or lessen an episode, may help. Permanent pacing has been useful in 
a subset of patients with significant bradycardia.

theophylline,  selective  serotonin 

A  variant  of  the  neurocardiogenic  response,  postural  orthostatic 
tachycardia syndrome (POTS), is characterized by dramatic increases 
in heart rate during the first 10 minutes of tilt-table testing. POTS appears 
to  be  distinct  from  simple  orthostatic  hypotension,  as  well  as  from 
standard neurocardiogenic responses, and is thought to be caused by 
various forms of autonomic imbalance. Relief of symptoms has been 
effected with fludrocortisone, beta blockers, or combinations.

Esophageal Electrocardiography
Esophageal electrocardiography is a useful noninvasive technique for 
diagnosing arrhythmias. The esophagus is located immediately behind 
the left atrium, between the left and right pulmonary veins. An elec-
trode  in  the  lumen  of  the  esophagus  can  record  atrial  potentials. 
Bipolar  recording  is  superior  to  unipolar  recording  because  far-field 
ventricular events can lead to possible diagnostic confusion with uni-
polar recording. In addition, atrial and occasionally ventricular pacing 
can be performed by means of a catheter electrode inserted into the 
esophagus, and tachycardias can be initiated and terminated. Optimal 
electrode position for atrial pacing correlates with the patients height 
and is within about 1 cm of the site at which the maximum amplitude 
of the atrial electrogram is recorded. When it is recorded simultane-
ously  with  the  surface  ECG,  the  esophageal  atrial  electrogram  can   
be  used  to  differentiate  SVT  with  aberrancy  from  VT  and  to  define 
the mechanism of SVTs. Complications of transesophageal recording 
and  pacing  are  uncommon,  but  the  technique  is  cumbersome  and 
uncomfortable  for  most  patients,  and  it  is  therefore  not  commonly 
used.

INVASIVEELECTROPHYSIOLOGICSTUDIES

An invasive EPS involves introducing multipolar catheter electrodes 
into  the  venous  or  arterial  system  and  positioning  them  at  various 

intracardiac  sites  to  record  or  stimulate  cardiac  electrical  activity. 
Assessment of AV conduction at rest is done by positioning the cath-
eter along the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and measuring the 
atrial-His  interval  (an  estimate  of  AV  nodal  conduction  time;  nor-
mally, 60 to 125 milliseconds) and the His-ventricular (H-V) interval 
(a  measure  of  infranodal  conduction;  normally,  35  to  55  millisec-
onds). The heart is stimulated from portions of the atria or ventricles 
and from the region of the His bundle, bundle branches, accessory 
pathways, and other structures. Such studies are performed diagnos-
tically to provide information about the type of clinical rhythm dis-
turbance and insight into its electrophysiologic mechanism. An EPS 
is used therapeutically to terminate a tachycardia by electrical stimu-
lation or electroshock, to evaluate the effects of therapy by determin-
ing whether a particular intervention modifies or prevents electrical 
induction of a tachycardia or whether an electrical device properly 
senses  and  terminates  an  induced  tachyarrhythmia,  and  to  ablate 
myocardium  involved  in  the  tachycardia  and  prevent  further  epi-
sodes. Finally, these tests have been used prognostically to identify 
patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. The study may be helpful 
in  patients  with  AV  block,  intraventricular  conduction  disturbance, 
sinus  node  dysfunction,  tachycardia,  and  unexplained  syncope  or 
palpitations (see Chapter 40).

An  EPS  is  effective  at  initiating  VT  and  SVT  when  these  tachyar-
rhythmias  have  occurred  spontaneously.  This  enables  the  use  of 
similar stimulation techniques after an intervention (e.g., drug therapy 
or catheter or surgical ablation) to assess the efficacy of treatment. 
However, false-negative responses (not finding a particular electrical 
abnormality  known  to  be  present)  and  false-positive  responses 
(induction  of  a  nonclinical  arrhythmia)  may  complicate  interpreta-
tion of the results because many lack reproducibility. Altered auto-
nomic tone in a supine patient undergoing study, hemodynamic or 
ischemic  influences,  changing  anatomy  (e.g.,  new  infarction)  after 
the  study,  day-to-day  variability,  and  the  fact  that  the  test  uses  an 
artificial trigger (electrical stimulation) to induce the arrhythmia are 
several  of  many  factors  that  can  explain  the  occasional  disparity 
between  test  results  and  spontaneous  occurrence  of  arrhythmia. 
Overall,  the  diagnostic  validity  and  reproducibility  of  these  studies 
are  good,  and  they  are  safe  when  performed  by  skilled  clinical 
electrophysiologists.

Atrioventricular Block
In patients with AV block, the site of block usually dictates the clinical 
course  of  the  patient  and  whether  a  pacemaker  is  needed  (see 
Chapter 37). In general, the site of AV block can be determined from 
analysis of the regular ECG. When the site of block cannot be deter-
mined from such an analysis and when knowing the site of block is 
imperative  for  management  of  the  patient,  an  invasive  EPS  is  indi-
cated.  Candidates  include  symptomatic  patients  in  whom  a  His-
Purkinje block is suspected but not established and patients with AV 
block treated with a pacemaker who continue to be symptomatic and 
in whom a causal ventricular tachyarrhythmia is suspected. Possible 
candidates  are  those  with  second-  or  third-degree  AV  block,  for 
whom information about the site of block or its mechanism may help 
direct therapy or assess prognosis, and patients suspected of having 
concealed His bundle extrasystoles. Patients with block in the His-
Purkinje system become symptomatic because of periods of brady-
cardia  or  asystole  and  require  pacemaker  implantation  more  often 
than do patients who have AV nodal block. Type I (Wenckebach) AV 
block in older patients may have clinical implications similar to those 
for type II AV block. The results of EPS for evaluating the conduction 
system must be interpreted with caution, however. In rare cases, the 
process  of  recording  conduction  intervals  alters  their  values.  For 
example, catheter pressure on the AV node or His bundle can cause 
prolongation of the atrial-His or H-V interval and could lead to errone-
ous diagnosis and therapy.

Intraventricular Conduction Disturbance
For patients with an intraventricular conduction disturbance, an EPS 
provides  information  about  the  duration  of  the  H-V  interval,  which 
can  be  prolonged  with  a  normal  PR  interval  or  normal  with  a

FIGUREe34-3  Head-up tilt-table testing. Responses to tilt-table testing are shown; heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (BP) are plotted as time functions. In the 
upper panel, a normal response is an early, slight drop in BP with a compensatory increase in HR mediated by the autonomic nervous system. With autonomic dysfunction, a 
progressive fall in BP is not counteracted by an increase in HR. In postural tachycardia syndrome, an exaggerated increase in HR is seen. The bottom panel depicts findings with 
neurocardiogenic syncope: a pure vasodepressor response is a relatively sudden drop in BP without a marked change in HR, whereas a pure cardioinhibitory response shows a 
sudden decrease in HR without a change in BP. A mixed response shows decreases in both HR and BP.

Sinus  Node  Recovery  Time. 
Sinus node recovery time (SNRT) is a 
technique  that  can  be  useful  for 
evaluating  sinus  node  function.  The 
interval between the last paced high 
right  atrial  response  and  the  first 
spontaneous  (sinus)  high  right  atrial 
response after termination of pacing 
is  measured  to  determine  SNRT. 
Because  the  spontaneous  sinus  rate 
influences  SNRT,  the  value  is  cor-
rected by subtracting the spontane-
ous  sinus  node  cycle  length  (before 
pacing)  from  the  SNRT  (Fig.  34-9). 
This  value, 
the  corrected  SNRT 
(CSNRT),  is  generally  shorter  than 
525  milliseconds.  A  prolonged 
CSNRT  has  been  found  in  patients 
suspected of having sinus node dys-
function.  After  cessation  of  pacing, 
the  first  return  sinus  cycle  can  be 
normal  but  can  be  followed  by  sec-
ondary  pauses.  Secondary  pauses 
appear  to  be  more  common  in 
patients  whose  sinus  node  dysfunc-
tion is caused by sinoatrial exit block 
(a potential cause of sinus pauses on 
the  ECG).  Direct  recordings  of  the 
sinus  node  electrogram  have  been 
made, but the technique is cumber-
some. Finally, it is important to evalu-
ate  AV  node  and  His-Purkinje 
function in patients with sinus node 
dysfunction  because  many  also 
exhibit impaired AV conduction.

prolonged PR interval. A prolonged H-V interval (>55 milliseconds) 
is associated with a greater likelihood for the development of a trifas-
cicular block (but the rate of progression is slow, 2% to 3% annually) 
and  for  having  structural  disease  and  with  higher  mortality.16  The 
finding of very long H-V intervals (>80 to 90 milliseconds) identifies 
patients at increased risk for the development of AV block. The H-V 
interval  has  high  specificity  (80%)  but  low  sensitivity  (66%)  for 
predicting the development of complete AV block. During the study, 
atrial pacing is used to uncover abnormal His-Purkinje conduction. 
A positive response is provocation of distal His block during 1:1 AV 
nodal conduction at rates of 135 beats/min or less. Again, sensitivity 
is  low  but  specificity  is  high.  Functional  His-Purkinje  block  caused 
by normal His-Purkinje refractoriness is not a positive response. Drug 
infusion, such as with procainamide or ajmaline, sometimes exposes 
abnormal His-Purkinje conduction (Fig.  34-8). Ajmaline (not avail-
able in the United States) can cause arrhythmias and should be used 
cautiously.

An EPS is indicated in patients with symptoms (syncope or presyn-
cope) that appear to be related to a bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhyth-
mia when no other cause of symptoms is found. For many of these 
patients, ventricular tachyarrhythmias rather than AV block can be 
the cause of their symptoms, with obvious therapeutic implications.

Sinus Node Dysfunction
Demonstration of slow sinus rates, sinus exit block, or sinus pauses 
temporally  related  to  symptoms  suggests  a  causal  relationship  and 
usually obviates further diagnostic studies (see Chapter 37). Carotid 
sinus pressure that results in several seconds of complete asystole or 
AV block and reproduces the patients usual symptoms exposes the 
presence  of  a  hypersensitive  carotid  sinus  reflex.  Carotid  sinus 
massage must be done cautiously; rarely, it can precipitate a stroke. 
Neurohumoral  agents,  adenosine,  or  stress  testing  can  be  used  to 
evaluate  the  effects  of  autonomic  tone  on  sinus  node  automaticity 
and  sinoatrial  conduction  time.  An  EPS  should  be  considered  in 
patients who have symptoms attributable to bradycardia or asystole, 
such  as  presyncope  or  syncope,  and  for  whom  noninvasive 
approaches have provided no explanation for the symptoms.

Sinoatrial  Conduction  Time. 
Sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) can be estimated by simple pacing 
techniques based on the assumptions that (1) conduction times into 
and out of the sinus node are equal, (2) no depression of sinus node 
automaticity occurs, and (3) the pacemaker site does not shift after 
premature stimulation (see Chapter 34). These assumptions can be 
erroneous, particularly in patients with sinus node dysfunction. SACT 
can  also  be  measured  directly  with  special  recording  techniques,  as 
noted above, from the region of the sinus node. This direct measure-
ment  correlates  well  with  the  SACT  measured  indirectly  in  patients 
with normal sinus node function. The sensitivity of the SACT and SNRT 
tests is only approximately 50% for each test alone and around 65% 
when they are combined. The specificity, combined, is approximately 
88%, with a low predictive value. Thus if these test results are abnor-
mal,  the  likelihood  of  the  patient  having  sinus  node  dysfunction  is 
great. However, normal results do not exclude the possibility of sinus 
node disease. Candidates for invasive EPS to evaluate sinus node func-
tion  are  symptomatic  patients  in  whom  sinus  node  dysfunction  has 
not been established as a cause of the symptoms. Potential candidates 
are patients with clinical sinus node dysfunction in whom other causes 
of symptoms (e.g., tachyarrhythmias) are to be excluded.

Tachycardia
In  patients  with  tachycardias,  an  EPS  can  be  used  to  diagnose  the 
arrhythmia,  to  determine  and  deliver  therapy,  to  establish  the  ana-
tomic  sites  involved  in  the  tachycardia,  to  identify  patients  at  high 
risk for the development of serious arrhythmias, and to gain insight 
into  the  mechanisms  responsible  for  the  arrhythmia  (see  Chapter 
37). The study can differentiate aberrant supraventricular conduction 
from  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  when  standard  electrocardio-
graphic criteria are equivocal.

An  SVT  is  recognized  electrophysiologically  by  an  H-V  interval 
equaling  or  exceeding  that  recorded  during  normal  sinus  rhythm 
(Fig. 34-10). In contrast, during VT, the H-V interval is shorter than 
normal or the His deflection cannot be recorded clearly because of 
superimposition of the larger ventricular electrogram. Only two situ-
ations exist in which a consistently short H-V interval occurs: during 
retrograde activation of the His bundle from activation originating in 
the  ventricle  (i.e.,  PVC,  ventricular  pacing,  or  VT)  and  during  AV 
conduction  over  an  accessory  pathway  (preexcitation  syndrome).

An EPS should be considered 
for the following circumstances: 
(1)  in  patients  who  have  symp-
recurrent,  or  drug-
tomatic, 
resistant 
supraventricular  or 
ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  to  help  select  optimal  therapy;  (2)  in 
patients with tachyarrhythmias occurring too infrequently to permit 
adequate diagnostic or therapeutic assessment; (3) for differentiation 
of SVT and aberrant conduction from VT; (4) whenever nonpharma-
cologic therapy, such as the use of electrical devices, catheter abla-
tion, or surgery, is contemplated; (5) in patients surviving an episode 
of cardiac arrest occurring more than 48 hours after acute myocardial 
infarction or without evidence of an acute Q wave myocardial infarc-
tion; and (6) for assessment of the risk for sustained VT in patients 
with a previous myocardial infarction, ejection fraction of 0.3 to 0.4, 
and nonsustained VT on an ECG. In general, EPS is not indicated in 
patients with long-QT syndrome and torsades de pointes.

The process of initiation and termination of SVT or VT with pro-
grammed  electrical  stimulation  to  establish  precise  diagnoses  and 
help select sites for catheter ablation is the most common application 
of EPS in patients with tachycardia. The role of drug therapy in clini-
cally significant arrhythmias continues to diminish; although EPS was 
once widely used to predict the efficacy of drug therapy in suppress-
ing  spontaneous  tachycardia  recurrences,  the  technique  is  now 
rarely  used  for  this  purpose.  Noninvasive  stimulation  from  an 
implanted pacemaker or defibrillator can be used to test the effects 
of  drug  therapy  given  in  an  attempt  to  decrease  the  frequency  of 
arrhythmias, as well as to test the ICDs ability to detect and treat VT 
that has been slowed or otherwise altered by drug effect.

Unexplained Syncope
The  three  common  arrhythmic  causes  of  syncope  are  sinus  node 
dysfunction, AV block, and tachyarrhythmias (see Chapter 40). Of 
the three, tachyarrhythmias are most reliably evaluated in the elec-
trophysiology laboratory, followed by sinus node abnormalities and 
His-Purkinje block.

The cause of syncope remains uncertain in up to 50% of patients, 
depending  in  part  on  the  extent  of  the  evaluation.  A  careful,  accu-
rately performed history and physical examination begin the evalua-
tion, followed by noninvasive tests, including a 12-lead ECG, and can 
lead to a diagnosis in 50% or more of patients. In a small percentage 
(<5%) of patients, an arrhythmia develops coincident with syncope 
or  presyncope  during  24-  or  48-hour  ECG  monitoring,  whereas  a 
larger  percentage  (15%)  have  symptoms  without  an  arrhythmia, 
thereby excluding an arrhythmic cause. Prolonged ECG monitoring 
with  patient-activated  transtelephonic  event  recorders  that  have 
memory loops may increase the yield. Tilt-table and stress testing can 
be useful for selected patients.

An EPS helps explain the cause of syncope or palpitations when it 
induces  an  arrhythmia  that  replicates  the  patients  symptoms  or  is 
associated  with  significant  hypotension.  Patients  with  a  single 
episode of syncope and no evidence of structural heart disease, as 
well  as  those  with  a  nondiagnostic  EPS,  have  a  low  incidence  of 
sudden death and an 80% remission rate over the ensuing 10 years. 
In those with recurrent syncope, the test is falsely negative in 20%, 
usually because of failure to find AV block or sinus node dysfunction. 

On  the  other  hand,  in  many  patients  with  structural  heart  disease, 
several abnormalities may be present that could account for syncope 
and can be diagnosed at EPS. Deciding which among these abnor-
malities  is  responsible  for  syncope  and  therefore  requires  therapy, 
and  of  what  type,  can  be  difficult  (Fig.  34-11).  Mortality  and  the 
incidence  of  sudden  cardiac  death  are  determined  mainly  by  the 
presence of underlying heart disease.

Syncopal  patients  considered  for  an  EPS  are  those  whose  spells 
remain  undiagnosed  despite  general,  neurologic,  and  noninvasive 
cardiac  evaluation,  particularly  if  the  patient  has  structural  heart 
disease.17 The diagnostic yield is approximately 70% in that group but 
only around 12% in patients without structural heart disease. Therapy 
for a putative cause found during EPS prevents recurrence of syncope 
in  approximately  80%  of  patients.  Among  arrhythmic  causes  of 
syncope, intermittent conduction disturbances are the most difficult 
to diagnose. EPS is poor in establishing this diagnosis despite an array 
of provocative tests that can be used. When tachyarrhythmias have 
been thoroughly sought and excluded and clinical suspicion for inter-
mittent  heart  block  is  high  (e.g.,  bundle  branch  block  or  long  H-V 
interval), empiric permanent pacing may be justified.

In  patients  with  a  nondiagnostic  EPS,  injection  of  adenosine  tri-
phosphate  (different  from  plain  adenosine)  distinguishes  patients 
who may benefit from permanent pacing (those with longer than a 
10-second  sinus  pause  or  AV  block)  from  those  who  do  not.  Some 
have suggested that this test be performed before EPS in some cases 
or  after  a  negative  EPS  but  before  an  implantable  loop  recorder  is 
placed.18

Palpitations
An EPS is indicated in patients with palpitations who have had a pulse 
documented  by  medical  personnel  to  be  inappropriately  rapid  or 
slow  without  an  electrocardiographic  recording  and  in  those  sus-
pected of having clinically significant palpitations without electrocar-
diographic documentation.

In patients with syncope or palpitations, the sensitivity of EPS may 
be low but can be increased at the expense of specificity. For example, 
more aggressive pacing techniques (e.g., use of three or four prema-
ture stimuli), administration of drugs (e.g., isoproterenol), or left ven-
tricular pacing can increase the likelihood of induction of ventricular 
arrhythmias  by  precipitating  nonclinical  ventricular  tachyarrhyth-
mias, such as nonsustained polymorphic or monomorphic VT or VF. 
Similarly, aggressive techniques during atrial pacing can induce non-
specific episodes of AF or atrial flutter. A diagnostic dilemma arises 
when the patients clinical, symptom-producing arrhythmia is one of 
these  nonspecific  arrhythmias  that  can  be  produced  in  a  normal 
patient who has no arrhythmia. In most patients, these arrhythmias 
are  regarded  as  nonclinical  (i.e.,  nonspecific  responses  to  intense 
stimulation).  In  other  patients,  such  as  those  with  hypertrophic  or 
dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, they may be clinically relevant 
arrhythmias.  However,  induction  of  sustained  SVT  (e.g.,  AV  nodal 
reentry, AV reciprocating tachycardia) or monomorphic VT is almost

never an artifact of stimulation, no matter how intense. Initiation of 
these arrhythmias in patients who have not had known spontaneous 
episodes of these tachycardias is uncommon and provides important 
information; for example, the induced tachyarrhythmia may be clini-
cally significant and responsible for the patients symptoms. In addi-
tion,  inducible  SVT  episodes  can  have  important  implications  for 
patients  with  ICDs  that  may  deliver  inappropriate  therapy  for  such 
arrhythmias. In general, other abnormalities, such as prolonged sinus 
pauses after overdrive atrial pacing or His-Purkinje AV block, are not 
induced in patients who do not or may not experience these abnor-
malities spontaneously. Provocation of these abnormalities has a high 
degree of specificity for clinical relevance.

ComplicationsofElectrophysiologic
Studies
The risks associated with undergoing only an EPS are small. Myocar-
dial perforation with cardiac tamponade, pseudoaneurysms at arte-
rial  access  sites,  and  provocation  of  nonclinical  arrhythmias  can 
occur,  each  with  less  than  a  1  per  500  incidence.  The  addition  of 
therapeutic maneuvers (e.g., ablation) to the procedure increases the 
incidence  of  complications.  In  a  European  survey  of  4398  patients 
reported from 68 institutions, the rate of ablation procedurerelated 
complications  ranged  from  3.2%  to  8%.  Five  deaths  occurred  
within  the  perioperative  period  of  the  ablation.  In  a  Heart  Rhythm 
Society  (formerly  North  American  Society  of  Pacing  and  Electro-
physiology) survey of 164 hospitals reporting in 1998 on more than 
3300 patients who had undergone radiofrequency ablation, compli-
cations developed in 1% to 3%, with procedure-related deaths occur-
ring  in  approximately  0.2%.  In  a  study  of  1050  patients  undergoing 
temperature-controlled ablation for supraventricular arrhythmias, 32 
(3%)  had  a  major  complication.  Predictors  of  major  complications 
were ejection fractions lower than 0.35 and multiple ablation targets. 
The improvement in the complication rate probably reflects the learn-
ing  curve  for  radiofrequency  ablation.  In  many  centers,  diagnostic 
EPS and even ablation procedures are performed on an outpatient 
basis (i.e., same-day discharge). With the increasing use of extensive 
ablation in the left atrium to treat AF, an increase in systemic throm-
boembolic  complications  has  been  observed,  as  have  pericardial 
effusion  and  tamponade,  valve  damage,  and  phrenic  nerve  injury 
(see Chapter 37).19

DIRECTCARDIACMAPPING:RECORDING
POTENTIALSDIRECTLYFROMTHEHEART

Cardiac  mapping  is  a  method  whereby  potentials  recorded  directly 
from the heart are spatially depicted as a function of time in an inte-
grated manner (Fig. 34-12). The location of recording electrodes (e.g., 
epicardial, intramural, or endocardial) and the recording mode used 
(unipolar versus bipolar), as well as the method of display (isopotential, 
isochronal, unipolar, or bipolar voltage maps), depend on the problem 
under consideration.

Direct cardiac mapping by catheter electrodes or, less commonly, at 
the time of cardiac surgery can be used to identify and localize the areas 
responsible for rhythm disturbances in patients with supraventricular 
and ventricular tachyarrhythmias for catheter or surgical ablation, isola-
tion, or resection. Conditions amenable to this approach include acces-
sory pathways associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the 
pathways in AV node reentry, AV nodeHis bundle ablation, sites of 
origin of focal atrial tachycardia and VTs, isolated pathways essential 
for the maintenance of reentrant atrial tachycardia or VTs, and various 
substrates responsible for episodes of AF (Videos 34-1 and 34-2) (see 
Chapter  38).  Mapping  can  also  be  used  to  delineate  the  anatomic 
course of the His bundle to avoid injury during catheter ablation or 
open heart surgery for repair of congenital heart disease.

Early efforts at mapping involved moving an electrode from location 
to location, acquiring data from a single point at a time, and compar-
ing the timing of local activation with some reference recording, as 
well as other mapped sites. Knowing when enough data points had 
been  obtained  to  determine  where  ablation  should  be  performed 
relied  heavily  on  the  memory  of  the  operator.  Specialized  mapping 
systems have now been developed that use computers to log not only 
the  activation  times  and  electrogram  amplitude  (voltage)  at  various 
points  in  the  heart  but  also  the  physical  locations  from  which  they 
were obtained.20 The mapping information acquired in this way can 
be displayed on a screen to show relative activation times in a color-
coded sequence. By use of such systems, dozens or even hundreds of 
sites  can  be  sampled  relatively  quickly,  thereby  leading  to  a  clear 
picture  of  cardiac  activation  and  potential  target  sites  for  ablation 
(Figs.  34-13  and  34-14).  These  systems  can  also  record  the  signal 
amplitude at each site sampled to allow differentiation of normal from 
scarred  myocardium,  which  can  help  in  planning  ablation  strategies 
(Fig.  34-15).  Other  mapping  systems  can  acquire  data  from  several 
thousand points simultaneously by using a multipolar electrode array. 
This is particularly useful for hemodynamically unstable tachycardias 
or  those  that  terminate  spontaneously  within  seconds,  which  pre-
cludes detailed point-to-point mapping.

cardial infarction leading to reentrant VT that originated in the border between scar and more normal myocardium, LAO = left anterior oblique; RAO = right anterior oblique. 

Pace mapping is a technique in which pacing is performed at puta-
tive  sites  from  which  arrhythmias  arise  (a  focus)  or  exit  (reentrant 
circuit). The greater the degree of match in QRS complexes (for VT) 
or  intracardiac  activation  sequences  (for  atrial  tachycardias),  the   
more likely that the paced site may be an appropriate site for ablation. 
Software  has  been  developed  to  calculate  the  fidelity  of  match  of   
the  paced  complexes  to  the  target  arrhythmia;  ideally,  this  should 
approach  100%.  Other  algorithms  have  been  developed  to  analyze 
propagation  patterns  during  complex  arrhythmias  such  as  AF  by 
recording signals from multielectrode basket catheters in the atrium 
(Fig.  34-16);  this  has  resolved  many  cases  of  an  apparently  chaotic 
rhythm  to  one  in  which  erratic  patterns  of  propagation  emanate   
from  a  stable  rapid  source  (either  rotor  or  focus).  Ablation  at   

these  source  sites  can  eliminate  AF.21  Work  is  ongoing  in  this  area. 
Finally,  although  computerized  mapping  systems  acquire  activation 
time and voltage at given sites in the heart, these features have been 
displayed  separately.  Ripple  mapping  is  a  new  technique  that   
integrates time and voltage information on the same display. Experi-
ence  with  this  technique  is  limited,  but  the  early  results  are 
promising.22

Current mapping systems have the ability to both integrate previous 
imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) 
into the procedure for additional anatomic reference and derive ana-
tomic information by moving a catheter throughout a cardiac chamber 
to develop a contour of its inner surface on which activation or voltage 
data can be plotted.

GUIDELINES
Ambulatory
Electrocardiographicand
ElectrophysiologicTesting
John M. Miller and Douglas P. Zipes

Guidelines  for  the  appropriate  use  of  ambulatory  electrocardiogra-
phy (ECG) were first published by the American College of Cardiology/
American  Heart  Association  (ACC/AHA)  in  19891  and  updated  in 
1999.2  In  conjunction  with  other  professional  societies,  the  ACC/
AHA issued a statement of requirements for clinical competence in 
ambulatory ECG in 2001.3 Guidelines for performance of electrophysi-
ologic  testing  were  first  published  in  19854  and  updated  in  1989 
and 1995.5 A clinical competence statement was issued by the ACC/
AHA  for  electrophysiologic  studies  and  catheter  ablation  in  20006; 
this  was  updated  by  a  statement  on  training  in  electrophysiology, 
cardiac pacing, and arrhythmia management in 20067 and again in 
2008.8 The AHA and the North American Society of Pacing and Elec-
trophysiology (NASPE, now the Heart Rhythm Society) made recom-
mendations on safety-related topics, such as restrictions on driving, 

for  patients  with  arrhythmia  in  19969  and  updated  them  in  200710 
(covered  in  the  Guidelines  in  Chapter  38).  Since  then,  efforts  to 
update the guidelines have focused on appropriate indications for the 
use of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) 
because of rapid advances in knowledge about the ability of ICDs to 
improve  the  survival  of  patients  with  arrhythmia  with  or  without 
electrophysiologic testing. These guidelines were issued in 200211 and 
updated  in  2008  and  2013.12  Guidelines  on  ICD  use  are  further 
addressed in Chapter 38.

The standard ACC/AHA classification system is used for the follow-

ing indications:
Class I: conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agree-

ment that the test is useful and effective

Class II: conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a 
divergence of opinion about the usefulness or efficacy of perform-
ing the test

Class  IIa:  weight  of  evidence  or  opinion  in  favor  of  usefulness  or 

efficacy

Class IIb: usefulness or efficacy less well established by evidence or 

opinion

Class III: conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agree-
ment that the test is not useful or effective and in some cases may 
be harmful

677

Three levels are used to rate the evidence on which recommenda-
tions have been based. Level A recommendations are derived from 
data from multiple randomized clinical trials, level B recommenda-
tions are derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized 
studies, and level C recommendations are based on the consensus 
opinion of experts.

  Increasingly sophisticated monitoring capacity of pacemakers and 

ICDs
As  a  result  of  progress  in  these  areas  and  increased  knowledge 
about arrhythmias, ambulatory ECG is now considered to be of uncer-
tain appropriateness for many indications for which it was once an 
accepted strategy.

AMBULATORYELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

The evolution of guidelines for the use of ambulatory ECG from 1989 
to 1999 reflected important progress in several areas, including the 
following:
  Understanding of the limited usefulness of suppression of ventricu-

lar ectopy with drug therapy

  Solid-state  digital  technology,  which  facilitates  transtelephonic 

transmission of electrocardiographic data

  Technical advances in long-term event recorders
  Improved signal quality and interpretation
  Improved computer arrhythmia interpretation

Diagnosis
In assessing symptoms that may be caused by arrhythmias, ambula-
tory ECG (Holter) monitoring is clearly established for the evaluation 
of syncope (Table 34G-1; see Chapter 40). A 2006 AHA/ACC Foun-
dation  scientific  statement  on  the  evaluation  of  syncope  stipulates 
that the type and duration of ambulatory ECG monitoring are dictated 
by the frequency of symptoms.13 Holter monitors (24 to 48 hours) are 
appropriate for episodes that occur at least daily and event recorders 
(30 to 60 days) for episodes that occur at least monthly. Implantable 
loop  recorders  inserted  subcutaneously  can  record  bipolar  ECG 
signals  for  up  to  14  months.  In  patients  with  unexplained  syncope, 
use  of  an  implantable  loop  recorder  for  1  year  is  more  likely  to

TABLE34G-2  ACC/AHA Guidelines on Ambulatory Electrocardiography for Assessment of Pacemaker and Implantable 
Cardioverter-Defibrillator Function

CLASS

Class I (indicated)

Class IIa (good supportive evidence)

Class IIb (weak supportive 

evidence)

INDICATION

Evaluation of frequent symptoms of palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope to assess device function, to exclude 
myopotential inhibition and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, and to assist in the programming of enhanced 
features, such as rate responsivity and automatic mode switching

Evaluation of suspected component failure or malfunction when device interrogation is not definitive in 

establishing a diagnosis

To assess response to adjunctive pharmacologic therapy in patients receiving frequent ICD therapy

Evaluation of immediate postoperative pacemaker function after pacemaker or ICD implantation as an alternative 

or adjunct to continuous telemetric monitoring

Evaluation of the rate of supraventricular arrhythmias in patients with implanted defibrillators

Class III (not indicated)

Assessment of ICD or pacemaker malfunction when device interrogation, electrocardiogram, or other available 

data (e.g., chest radiograph) are sufficient to establish an underlying cause or diagnosis

Routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients

identify the mechanism of syncope than is a conventional approach 
that uses Holter or event monitors and electrophysiologic testing and 
is cost-effective.

Ambulatory ECG is also supported for the evaluation of recurrent 
palpitations, particularly if the frequency of these symptoms makes 
it  reasonably  likely  that  they  can  be  correlated  with  the  tracings 
obtained  during  a  24-hour  monitoring  period.  The  guidelines  note 
that data on the use of ambulatory ECG for near-syncope or dizziness 
are insufficient to describe the diagnostic performance of this tech-
nology for patients with such symptoms.

The  ACC/AHA  guidelines  explicitly  discourage  ambulatory  ECG  
for patients with syncope or palpitations if other causes have been 
identified  during  the  clinical  evaluation  and  for  patients  with  cere-
brovascular  accidents  and  no  other  evidence  of  arrhythmia.  The 
guidelines seek to reduce performance of ambulatory ECG for com-
pleteness in such cases. Little support is provided for use of ambula-
tory  ECG  in  cases  in  which  the  cause  of  the  patients  symptoms  is 
unclear  but  in  which  the  likelihood  of  detecting  an  unsuspected 
arrhythmia is low (class IIb indications).

AssessmentofRisk
The ACC/AHA guidelines discouraged the use of ambulatory ECG for 
either arrhythmia detection or analysis of heart rhythm variability for 
the  purpose  of  risk  assessment  in  patients  without  symptoms  of 
arrhythmia, even if they had cardiovascular conditions such as myo-
cardial  contusions,  left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  or  valvular  heart 
disease (see Table 34G-1). Routine use for patients in whom arrhyth-
mia is a common cause of death (left ventricular dysfunction, hyper-
trophic  cardiomyopathy)  was  considered  a  class  IIb  indication. 
These recommendations preceded data demonstrating the beneficial 
impact  of  ICDs  for  patients  with  left  ventricular  dysfunction  after 
acute  myocardial  infarction  even  without  symptoms  of  arrhythmia. 
These  more  recent  findings  are  leading  to  an  expanded  role  for 
ambulatory ECG in determining which asymptomatic patients most 
need these expensive devices.

EfficacyofAntiarrhythmicTherapy
In the absence of data demonstrating that oral antiarrhythmic therapy 
can  improve  survival  through  control  of  ventricular  arrhythmias, 
ambulatory ECG has a diminished role as a test for evaluation of the 
efficacy  of  treatment  (see  Table  34G-1).  Oral  antiarrhythmic  agents 
are important for control of supraventricular arrhythmias, but most 
patients with such arrhythmias do not have episodes every day. Event 
recorders  can  be  useful  for  documenting  the  relationship  between 
symptoms  and  recurrent  arrhythmia  and  the  interval  between  epi-
sodes, which can help guide therapy.

The guidelines provide some support of the use of ambulatory ECG 
for detection of proarrhythmia during initiation of drug therapy, but

AssessmentofPacemakerandImplantable
Cardioverter-DefibrillatorFunction
Ambulatory ECG was considered to be appropriate for evaluation of 
the function of pacemakers and ICDs (see Chapter 36), but the role 
of ambulatory ECG is being reduced by increasing the diagnostic and 
monitoring  functions  being  built  into  these  devices,  especially  with 
the  use  of  remote  monitoring.  Ambulatory  ECG  can  provide  useful 
information  by  correlating  symptoms  with  device  activity  and  by 
detecting  abnormalities  in  sensing  and  capture  during  chronic 
follow-up (Table 34G-2). However, the ACC/AHA guidelines empha-
size that ambulatory ECG should not be used when data available from 
device interrogation are sufficient to guide clinical management.

MonitoringforMyocardialIschemia
The 1999 ACC/AHA guidelines do not provide strong support of any 
indications for routine clinical use of ambulatory ECG monitoring for 
myocardial ischemia (Table 34G-3). The only indication for which 
the task force thought that there was good supportive evidence was 
suspected variant angina. This technology was not considered a first-
choice alternative to exercise testing for patients who are unable to 
exercise.

ClinicalCompetence
The ACC/AHA statement on clinical competence recommended that 
trainees interpret at least 150 ambulatory electrocardiograms under 

supervision  to  acquire  minimal  competence  in  this  technology.3  A 
minimum  of  25  test  interpretations  per  year  was  recommended  to 
maintain competence.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICPROCEDURES
FORDIAGNOSIS

The  ACC/AHA  guidelines  for  the  use  of  intracardiac  electrophysio-
logic  procedures  from  19854  and  19955  reflect  the  emerging  role  of 
catheter ablation as a therapeutic strategy but do not fully reflect the 
reduced importance of antiarrhythmic medications and the growing 
role  of  ICDs  that  have  occurred.  Nevertheless,  most  of  the  basic 
themes of these guidelines remain valid. An updated clinical compe-
tence statement for performing these procedures was issued in 2006.14

variability in sinus node function in asymptomatic individuals. Inva-
sive  tests  of  sinus  function  can  test  the  ability  of  the  sinus  node  to 
recover from overdrive suppression and assess sinoatrial conduction 
by introducing atrial extrastimuli or by atrial pacing.

The  ACC/AHA  guidelines  consider  electrophysiologic  studies  of 
sinus node function most appropriate for patients in whom dysfunc-
tion  is  suspected  but  not  proved  after  a  noninvasive  evaluation 
(Table  34G-4).  In  contrast,  the  guidelines  consider  such  studies 
inappropriate when a documented bradyarrhythmia has been found 
to  be  correlated  with  the  patients  symptoms  and  management  is 
unlikely to be influenced by an electrophysiologic study. Studies are 
also  considered  inappropriate  in  asymptomatic  patients  and  those 
who  have  sinus  pauses  only  during  sleep.  When  bradyarrhythmias 
were recognized as the cause of the patients symptoms, electrophysi-
ologic studies were considered to have possible but uncertain appro-
priateness (class II) if such data might refine treatment choices.

EvaluationofSinusNodeFunction
Clinical evaluation of sinus node dysfunction is often difficult because 
of  the  episodic  nature  of  symptomatic  abnormalities  and  the  wide 

AcquiredAtrioventricularBlock
The ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize that electrophysiologic studies 
are  inappropriate  (class  III)  when  ECG  findings  correlate  with

symptoms  and  the  findings  from  electrophysiologic  studies  are 
unlikely  to  alter  management  (e.g.,  documentation  of  His  bundle 
conduction rarely improves the management of a patient whose other 
clinical  data  indicate  that  placement  of  a  permanent  pacemaker  is 
warranted  because  of  symptomatic  advanced  atrioventricular  [AV] 
block).  Similarly,  electrophysiologic  studies  are  not  appropriate  for 
asymptomatic  patients  with  mild  degrees  of  AV  block  who  are  not 
likely to warrant pacemaker implantation. According to these guide-
lines,  electrophysiologic  studies  of  AV  conduction  should  be  per-
formed  when  a  relationship  between  symptoms  and  AV  block  is  a 
reasonable possibility but has not been proved.

ChronicIntraventricularDelay
According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, the main role of electrophysi-
ologic testing in patients with prolonged H-V intervals is not to predict 

future  complications  but  to  determine  whether  the  symptoms  of 
arrhythmia  are  caused  by  conduction  delay  or  block  versus  some 
other arrhythmia. The only class I (clearly appropriate) indication for 
electrophysiologic  testing  is  symptomatic  patients  for  whom  the 
cause of symptoms is not known. The guidelines specifically discour-
age such testing of asymptomatic patients and provide only equivo-
cal support for asymptomatic patients with bundle branch block in 
whom treatment with drugs that might increase conduction delay is 
being considered.

NarrowandWideQRSComplex
Tachycardia
The ACC/AHA guidelines define different roles for electrophysiologic 
testing in patients with narrow- and wide-complex tachycardias. In 
narrow-QRS tachycardia, the site of abnormal impulse formation or

the reentry circuit can often be determined from information on the 
12-lead electrocardiogram. Thus electrophysiologic testing was con-
sidered more appropriate as a guide to therapy in this setting than as 
a tool for diagnosis. Class I indications for electrophysiologic testing 
include  patients  with  recurrent  tachycardia  for  whom  data  from 
testing  may  help  clinicians  choose  among  drug  therapy,  catheter 
ablation,  pacing,  and  surgery.  However,  testing  is  not  considered 
useful  for  patients  whose  tachycardias  are  controlled  by  vagal 
maneuvers or medications and who are not candidates for nonphar-
macologic therapy.

In  wide-complex  tachycardias,  correct  diagnosis  is  occasionally 
not  possible  from  ECG  tracings  alone.  However,  electrophysiologic 
testing  permits  accurate  diagnosis  in  virtually  all  patients.  Because 
knowledge of the mechanism of the arrhythmia is essential for selec-
tion  of  optimal  therapy,  electrophysiologic  testing  was  considered 
appropriate (class I) for the diagnosis of wide-complex tachycardias 
in these guidelines. However, when the diagnosis is clear from other 
data and electrophysiologic testing is not likely to influence therapy, 
the guidelines consider it inappropriate.

ProlongedQTIntervals
The ACC/AHA guidelines do not consider routine use of electrophysi-
ologic  testing  appropriate  for  any  indications  in  patients  with  pro-
longed QT intervals. Whether catecholamine infusion during testing 
is useful for revealing patients who are at high risk for complications 
or whether electrophysiologic testing can be used to evaluate proar-
rhythmic effects in this population is considered uncertain.

Wolff-Parkinson-WhiteSyndrome
Electrophysiologic  testing  is  useful  for  patients  with  this  syndrome 
for both diagnosis and planning of therapy. The ACC/AHA guidelines 
consider electrophysiologic testing appropriate for patients who are 
candidates for catheter or surgical ablation, for those who have had 
cardiac arrests or unexplained syncope, or for patients whose man-
agement  might  be  altered  by  knowledge  of  the  electrophysiologic 
properties of the accessory pathway and normal conduction system. 
For  asymptomatic  patients,  however,  electrophysiologic  studies  are 
deemed inappropriate except in special situations, such as patients 
with high-risk occupations or those with a family history of sudden 
cardiac  death.  More  recently  recognized  entities,  such  as  Brugada 

681

syndrome, catecholaminergic tachycardia, and right ventricular car-
diomyopathy, were not considered.

NonsustainedVentricularTachycardia
For  patients  with  ventricular  premature  complexes,  couplets,  and 
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the usefulness of electrophysi-
ologic  testing  is  compromised  by  the  lack  of  therapeutic  strategies 
that  have  been  shown  to  improve  outcomes.  There  are  no  clearly 
appropriate  indications  for  electrophysiologic  studies  in  these 
patients,  and  the  guidelines  discourage  testing  in  patients  without 
other  risk  factors  for  sustained  arrhythmias.  Research  published 
since  these  guidelines  suggests  that  exceptions  would  include 
patients  who  fit  the  MADIT  (Multicenter  Automatic  Defibrillator 
Implantation Trial) or MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia 
Trial)  criteria.  For  certain  patients  with  other  data  suggesting  an 
adverse prognosis, electrophysiologic testing is thought to have pos-
sible but unproven appropriateness (class II).

UnexplainedSyncope
In  patients  with  unexplained  syncope  and  structural  heart  disease 
(see Chapter 40), recent ACC/AHA guidelines on the evaluation of 
syncope10 recommend a low threshold for the use of electrophysio-
logic  testing  (Table  34G-5).  In  patients  without  structural  heart 
disease, the yield of electrophysiologic testing is low. Thus the guide-
lines  recommend  a  higher  threshold  for  use  of  electrophysiologic 
studies in such patients and suggest that head-up tilt testing may be 
a more useful test. However, given the low risk associated with elec-
trophysiologic testing and the high risk for potentially harmful recur-
rent syncope, electrophysiologic testing may be beneficial for patients 
with a malignant episode of syncope.13

SurvivorsofCardiacArrest
The ACC/AHA guidelines consider electrophysiologic testing appro-
priate for patients who are survivors of cardiac arrest (see Chapter 
39)  other  than  in  the  earliest  phase  of  acute  myocardial  infarction 
(see Table 34G-5). Since publication of these guidelines, acceptance 
of the usefulness of ICDs has become more widespread, and many 
of  these  patients  receive  such  a  device  without  electrophysiologic 
testing  or  undergo  limited  electrophysiologic  testing  at  device

implantation.  The  guidelines  consider  electrophysiologic  studies 
inappropriate  when  cardiac  arrest  has  occurred  within  the  first  48 
hours of myocardial infarction or when the cardiac arrest results from 
clearly definable specific causes.

UnexplainedPalpitations
The  procedure  of  choice  to  determine  the  cause  of  palpitations  is 
ambulatory  ECG  according  to  the  ACC/AHA  guidelines.  The  guide-
lines  suggest  that  electrophysiologic  testing  should  be  reserved  for 
patients  with  palpitations  that  are  associated  with  syncope  or  for 
those in whom electrocardiograms have failed to capture a cause of 
the palpitations but who have been noted to have a rapid pulse rate 
by medical personnel (see Table 34G-5). Electrophysiologic testing is 
considered  to  be  of  equivocal  value  in  patients  with  symptoms  so 
sporadic that they cannot be documented while ambulatory ECG is 
performed.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICSTUDIESFOR
THERAPEUTICINTERVENTION

The 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines on the appropriateness of electrophysi-
ologic studies for guidance of drug therapy and implantable electri-
cal devices do not reflect the decline in the role of oral antiarrhythmic 
therapy and the rise in the use of ICDs for the treatment of patients 
who have experienced cardiac arrest (Table 34G-6). However, the 
guideline recommendations for the role of catheter ablation remain 
valid.  Characteristics  that  are  common  among  appropriate  indica-
tions  include  supraventricular  arrhythmias,  including  atrial  fibrilla-
tion, that are symptomatic; that cannot be controlled with medications 
because  of  limited  effectiveness,  side  effects,  or  inconvenience;  or 
that  have  caused  sudden  cardiac  death.15  Catheter  ablation  is  also 
useful for the same reasons in some patients with ventricular tachy-
cardia when it occurs in the absence of structural heart disease, and

intolerant or does not desire long-
term drug therapy

drug, ICD, or surgical therapy 
that is well tolerated and 
preferred by the patient over 
ablation

Asymptomatic and clinically 

benign nonsustained VT

AVNRT = AV nodal reentrant tachycardia; MI = myocardial infarction; VT = ventricular tachycardia.

ablation  is  often  useful  as  an  adjunct  to  ICD  implantation  to  limit 
episodes  of  ventricular  tachycardia  requiring  ICD  treatment.16  Left 
ventricular dysfunction develops in some patients from frequent pre-
mature ventricular complexes, with reversal occurring after ablation 
of the premature ventricular complex.

ClinicalCompetence
The  ACC/AHA  statement  on  clinical  competence8  describes  three 
levels of training: level 1 for every cardiology trainee, level 2 for those 
wishing to acquire advanced training in the management of arrhyth-
mia, and level 3 for those intending to specialize in invasive diagnos-
tic and therapeutic cardiac electrophysiology. The level 3 guidelines 
recommend a minimum of 1 year of specialized training in electro-
physiologic studies, during which the physician should be the primary 
operator and analyze 100 to 150 initial diagnostic studies, at least 50 
of which should involve patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 
Because  antiarrhythmic  devices  constitute  a  major  part  of  current 
electrophysiology  practice,  the  guidelines  suggest  that  a  trainee 
should be the primary operator during at least 25 electrophysiologic 
evaluations of implantable antiarrhythmic devices. For maintenance 
of  competence,  a  minimum  of  100  diagnostic  electrophysiologic 
studies per year is recommended. The statement also recommends 
that specialists in electrophysiology attend at least 30 hours of formal 
continuing  medical  education  every  2  years  to  remain  abreast  of 
changes in knowledge and technology.

For physicians who perform catheter ablation, the NASPE Ad Hoc 
Committee on Catheter Ablation (now the Heart Rhythm Society) has 
recommended that training should include at least 75 catheter abla-
tions, at least 10 of which are accessory pathway ablations and 30 to 
50  are  mentored  ablations.8  The  ACC/AHA  statement  recommends 
that  physicians  who  perform  ablations  carry  out  at  least  20  to  50 
ablations per year.

Individuals receiving training in pacemaker implantation must par-
ticipate as the primary operator (under direct supervision) in at least 
50  primary  implantations  of  transvenous  pacemakers  and  20  pace-
maker system revisions or replacements. At least half of the implanta-
tions  should  involve  dual-chamber  pacemakers.  The  trainee  must 
also  participate  in  the  follow-up  of  at  least  100  pacemaker  patient 
visits and acquire proficiency in advanced pacemaker electrocardi-
ography, interrogation, and programming of complex pacemakers.8
