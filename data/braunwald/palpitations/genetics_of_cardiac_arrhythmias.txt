Cardiac arrhythmias encompass a large and heterogeneous group of 
electrical abnormalities of the heart, with or without underlying struc-
tural heart disease. Cardiac arrhythmias can be innocuous, can pre-
dispose to the development of potentially lethal stroke or embolism, 
or can be an emergency, life-threatening condition that may result in 
sudden  cardiac  death  (SCD),  one  of  the  most  common  causes  of 
death in the developed countries. In the United States, for example, 
an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 individuals die suddenly each year, 
with the vast majority involving the elderly; 80% are caused by ven-
tricular fibrillation in the context of ischemic heart disease. In com-
parison, SCD in the young is relatively uncommon, with an incidence 
between 1.3 and 8.5 per 100,000 patient-years.1 However, tragically, 
thousands of otherwise healthy individuals younger than 40 years die 
suddenly each year without warning. Most SCD in the young can be 
attributed  to  structural  cardiovascular  anomalies  identifiable  at 
autopsy, but in as many as 30% to 50% of such individuals, sudden 
death remains unexplained following a complete autopsy and medi-
colegal investigation (see Chapter 39).

Potentially lethal and inheritable arrhythmia syndromes included 
under the umbrella of cardiac channelopathies, such as congenital 
long-QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), catecholamin-
ergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and related disor-
ders, involve electrical disturbances with the propensity to produce 
fatal arrhythmias in the setting of a structurally normal heart. These 
often unassuming electrical abnormalities have the capacity to cause 
a potentially lethal arrhythmia to develop in the heart of an unsus-
pecting, otherwise healthy individual and lead to sudden and early 
demise.1 In fact, it is now recognized that almost a third of autopsy-
negative  sudden  unexplained  deaths  (SUDs)  in  the  young2  and 
approximately 10% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 
stem from these genetically inherited cardiac channelopathies.3,4

Through molecular advances in the field of cardiovascular genet-
ics,  the  underlying  genetic  bases  responsible  for  many  inherited 
cardiac arrhythmia syndromes have come to light, and the underly-
ing  genetic  substrates  responsible  for  other  such  syndromes  are  
on  the  cusp  of  discovery.  Over  the  past  decade,  a  particular  set  of 
themes, 
including  extreme  genetic  heterogeneity,  reduced  or  
incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity, has proved to be 
commonplace  among  the  cardiac  channelopathies.  However,  for 
some disorders, important genotype-phenotype correlates have been 

recognized and have provided diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeu-
tic  impact.  The  clinical  description,  genetic  basis,  and  genotype-
phenotype  correlates  associated  with  these  inherited  arrhythmia 
syndromes are discussed in this chapter.

THEQT-OPATHIES
Long-QTSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations of Long-QT 
Syndrome
Congenital LQTS comprises a distinct group of cardiac channelopa-
thies characterized by delayed repolarization of the myocardium, QT 
prolongation  (QTc  >480  msec  as  the  50th  percentile  in  genetically 
confirmed LQTS cohorts), and increased risk for syncope, seizures, 
and SCD in the setting of a structurally normal heart and otherwise 
healthy  individual.  The  incidence  of  LQTS  may  exceed  1  in  2500 
persons.5 Individuals with LQTS may or may not manifest QT prolon-
gation  on  a  resting  12-lead  surface  electrocardiogram  (ECG).  This 
repolarization  abnormality  is  almost  always  without  consequence; 
however,  triggers  such  as  exertion,  swimming,  emotion,  auditory 
stimuli  (e.g.,  alarm  clock),  and  the  postpartum  period  can  rarely 
cause  the  heart  to  become  electrically  unstable  and  result  in  the 
development of the potentially life-threatening and sometimes lethal 
arrhythmia of torsades de pointes (TdP) (see Chapter 37). Although 
the cardiac rhythm most often returns to normal spontaneously, with 
only a transient episode of syncope, 5% of individuals with untreated 
and unsuspected LQTS succumb to a fatal arrhythmia as their senti-
nel event. However, it is estimated that nearly half of the individuals 
experiencing SCD stemming from this very treatable arrhythmogenic 
disorder may have previously exhibited warning signs (i.e., exertional 
syncope, family history of premature sudden death) that went unrec-
ognized.2 LQTS may explain approximately 20% of autopsy-negative 
SUDs in the young and 10% of cases of SIDS.2,3

Genetic Basis for Long-QT Syndrome.  LQTS is a genetically het-
erogeneous  disorder  largely  inherited  in  an  autosomal  dominant 
pattern; it was previously known as Romano-Ward syndrome. Rarely, 
LQTS  is  inherited  as  a  recessive  trait  first  described  by  Jervell  and 
Lange-Nielsen and is characterized by a severe cardiac phenotype and 
sensorineural hearing loss. Spontaneous/sporadic germline mutations

can account for nearly 5% to 10% of cases of LQTS. To date, hundreds 
of  mutations  have  been  identified  in  10  LQTS  susceptibility  genes 
responsible for a nonsyndromic classic LQTS phenotype. In addition, 
two extremely rare, multisystem disorders associated with marked QT 
prolongation:  Timothy  syndrome  (TS),  formerly  annotated  as  LQT8, 
and prolonged QU intervals (Anderson-Tawil syndrome [ATS], formerly 
annotated as LQT7), and a third disorder, LQT4, which is better clas-
sified as ankyrin-B syndrome, have also been described.

Approximately 75% of patients with a clinically robust diagnosis of 
LQTS host either loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations in one 

of  three  major  LQTS  genes  (Table  32-1)the  KCNQ1-encoded  IKs 
(Kv7.1) potassium channel (LQT1, 35%; loss of function), the KCNH2- 
encoded IKr (Kv11.1) potassium channel (LQT2, 30%; loss of function), 
and  the  SCN5A-encoded  INa  (Nav1.5)  sodium  channel  (LQT3,  10%, 
gain of function)that are responsible for orchestration of the cardiac 
action potential6,7 (Fig. 32-1). Approximately 5% to 10% of patients 
have multiple mutations in these genes, and those with multiple LQTS 
mutations are affected at a younger age and exhibit greater expres-
sivity6  (see  Chapter  8).  The  most  recent  discovery  was  reported  in 
2012 by Boczek and colleagues following whole exome sequencing,

potential and the clinical phenotype of LQTS. Their subsequent muta-
tional analysis of 102 unrelated patients with robust clinical evidence 
of LQTS has indicated that 3% to 5% of genetically elusive cases of 
LQTS  may  be  attributed  to  CACNA1C  mutations,  thus  making 
CACNA1C  potentially  the  fifth  most  common  genetic  substrate  for 
nonsyndromic LQTS. The majority of the mutations identified reside 
in the CACNA1C-encoded critical PEST domain of the L-type calcium 
channel  (LTCC),  which  signals  for  rapid  protein  degradation.  These 
mutations presumably result in a biogenic increase in LTCCs at the cell 
surface membrane.

The  remaining  seven  minor  LQTS  susceptibility  genes  encode   

for  either  cardiac  ion  channels  or  key  cardiac  channel  interacting 
proteins (ChIPs) that generally regulate the native ion channel current 
and collectively explain perhaps 5% of cases of LQTS. The vast majority 
of LQTS susceptibility mutations consist of single nucleotide substitu-
tions  or  small  insertions/deletions  resulting  in  nonsynonymous  mis-
sense  (amino  acid  substitution  for  another  amino  acid),  nonsense 
(amino acid substitution for a termination codon), or splice site altera-
tions  (resulting  in  exon  skipping  or  intron  inclusion)  or  frameshift 
mutations (altered normal amino acid coding resulting in early termina-
tion).6,7,9 Recently, a few large gene rearrangements involving hundreds 
to thousands of nucleotides resulting in single or multiple deletions/
duplications  of  whole  exons  have  been  described.10,11  Importantly, 
quintessential  mutational  hot  spots  are  not  present  within  these 
genes, with the vast majority of unrelated families having their own 
unique private mutation. In 2013 it is important to note that nearly 
20% of clinically definite cases of LQTS remain genetically elusive.

C1159

In contrast to the rare, pathogenic LQTS-associated channel muta-
tions present in less than 0.04% (1/2500) of persons and in 75% of 
clinically robust LQTS cases, comprehensive genetic testing for KCNQ1, 
KCNH2, and SCN5A in more than 1300 ostensibly healthy volunteers 
has  revealed  that  approximately  4%  of  white  individuals  and  up  to 
8% of nonwhite individuals host rare nonsynonymous genetic variants 
(<0.5% allelic frequency) of these specific cardiac channel genes.12 In 
fact,  a  total  of  79  distinct  channel  variants  were  detected  in  these 
healthy subjects, including 14 variants in KCNQ1, 28 in KCNH2 and 37 
in SCN5A.12 This has enabled a case-control mutational analysis of the 
properties and localization of case-associated 
mutations relative to the compendium of pre-
sumably innocuous variants.12 The probabilis-
tic  rather  than  the  binary  nature  of  genetic 
testing  is  depicted  in  Figure  32-2,  which 
shows  that  rare  mutations  other  than  mis-
sense mutations (approximately 20% of the 
LQTS spectrum of mutations) are high-prob-
ability  LQTS-associated  mutations  whereas 
the probability of pathogenicity for the most 
common mutation type, missense mutations 
(i.e.,  single  amino  acid  substitutions),  is 
strongly  location  dependent.  For  example, 
missense  mutations  localizing  to  the  trans-
membrane-spanning/pore  domains  of  the 
LQT1- and LQT2-associated potassium chan-
nels  are  high-probability  disease  mutations, 
whereas  a  similarly  rare  missense  mutation 
that localizes to the domain I-II linker of the 
Nav1.5  sodium  channel  is  indeterminate,  a 
variant  of  uncertain  significance 
(VUS). 
Without  cosegregation  or  functional  data, 
such  a  mutation  has  a  point  estimate  for 
probability of pathogenicity of less than 50%.
In  addition  to  this  background  frequency 
(4%  to  8%)  of  rare  variants  in  health,  15 
unique  common  polymorphisms  (allelic  fre-
quency  >0.5%)  have  been  identified  in  the 
four  potassium  channel  subunit  genes 
(KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2), and 8 
common  polymorphisms  have  been  identi-
fied  in  the  sodium  channel  gene  (SCN5A). 
Many  of  these  rare  and  common  polymor-
phisms 
innocent  bystanders; 
however,  a  layer  of  complexity  is  added  to 
the  genetics  of  these  channelopathies,  and 
management  of  patients  with  otherwise 
apparently  innocuous  variants  can  modify 
disease.  For  example,  the  most  common 
sodium  channel  variant,  H558R,  which  has  
a  minor  allelic  frequency  of  approximately

29% in blacks, 23% in Hispanics, 20% in 
whites, and 9% in Asians, can provide a 
modifying  effect  on  the  disease  state 
through  intragenic  complementation 
(the interaction of two mutations within 
the  same  gene  that  produces  a  novel 
functional effect) of other SCN5A muta-
tions.13 In fact, several studies have indi-
cated  that  some  of  these  common 
polymorphisms may be informative clini-
cally and relevant to the identification of 
those at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, par-
ticularly  in  the  setting  of  TdP-inducing 
drugs or other environmental factors, as 
discussed later in this chapter.

FIGURE32-3  Genotype-phenotype correlations in LQTS. Seventy-five percent of cases of clinically strong LQTS are 
due to mutations in three genes (KCNQ1, 35%; KCNH2, 30%; and SCN5A, 10%) encoding for ion channels that are 
critically responsible for orchestration of the cardiac action potential. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been ob-
served, including swimming/exertion/emotion and LQT1, auditory triggers/postpartum period and LQT2, and sleep/rest 
and LQT3.

Genotype-Phenotype Correlates 
in Long-QT Syndrome
The  emergence  of  specific  genotype/
phenotype associations in LQTS suggest 
relatively gene-specific triggers, ECG pat-
terns,  and  response  to  therapy  (Fig. 
32-3). Swimming- and exertion-induced 
cardiac  events  are  strongly  associated 
with  mutations 
in  KCNQ1  (LQT1), 
whereas  auditory  triggers  and  events 
occurring during the postpartum period 
most often occur in patients with LQT2. 
Whereas  exertion-  or  emotional  stress
induced  events  are  most  common  in 
LQT1,  events  occurring  during  periods 
of  sleep  or  rest  are  most  common  in 
LQT3. In a study population of 721 LQT1 
and 634 LQT2 genetically confirmed patients from the U.S. portion 
of the international LQTS registry, a multivariate analysis was used to 
assess the independent contribution of clinical and mutation-specific 
factors  to  the  occurrence  of  a  first  triggered  event  associated  with 
exercise, arousal, or sleep/rest.14,15 Among the 221 symptomatic LQT1 
patients, the first cardiac event was most often associated with exer-
cise (55%), followed by sleep/rest (21%), arousal (14%), and nonspe-
cific (10%) triggers; in contrast, the 204 symptomatic LQT2 patients 
most often had their first event associated with either arousal triggers 
(44%) or nonexercise/nonarousal triggers (43%), and only 13% of the 
symptomatic LQT2 patients had an exercise-triggered first event. In 
addition, males younger than 13 years with LQT1 had a nearly 3-fold 
increase  in  risk  for  exercise-triggered  events,  whereas  females  13 
years or older with LQT1 had a 3.5-fold increase in risk for sleep/rest 
nonarousal  events.  For  LQT2  patients,  the  rate  of  arousal-triggered 
events  was  similar  between  boys  and  girls,  but  the  rate  of  arousal-
triggered events was significantly higher in women than in men (26% 
versus 6% at 40 years of age) after the onset of adolescence. Charac-
teristic  gene-suggestive  ECG  patterns  have  been  described  previ-
ously.  LQT1  is  associated  with  a  broad-based  T  wave,  LQT2  with  a 
low-amplitude  notched  or  biphasic  T  wave,  and  LQT3  with  a  long 
isoelectric segment followed by a narrow-based T wave.

However, exceptions to these relatively gene-specific T wave pat-
terns exist, and thus due caution must be exercised when making a 
pregenetic test prediction of the particular LQTS subtype involved 
because the most common clinical mimicker of an LQT3-appearing 
ECG is seen in patients with LQT1. This is key to keep in mind because 
importantly,  the  underlying  genetic  basis  heavily  influences  the 
response  to  standard  LQTS  pharmacotherapy  (beta  blockers),  with 
beta blockers being extremely protective in LQT1 patients and mod-
erately  protective  in  patients  with  LQT2  and  LQT3.16  Additionally, 
targeting  the  pathologic  LQT3-associated  late  sodium  current  with 
agents such as mexiletine, flecainide, or ranolazine may represent a 
gene-specific therapeutic option for LQT3.17,18 Attenuation in repolar-
ization with clinically apparent shortening of the QTc has been dem-
onstrated with such a strategy, although no evidence-based survival 
benefit  has  been  shown  thus  far.18  Realistically,  however,  at  least  a 

30-year study may be needed for the latter. Even though the general-
ization that beta blocker efficacy depends on the genotype has been 
well  accepted,  the  effectiveness  of  beta  blocker  therapy  may  be 
largely trigger-specific rather than dependent on genotype. In patients 
with either LQT1 or LQT2, beta blockade was associated with a pro-
nounced 71% (LQT2 patients) to 78% (LQT1 patients) reduction in the 
risk for exercise-triggered cardiac events but had no statistically sig-
nificant effect on the apparent risk for arousal- or sleep/rest-triggered 
events.4,15 However, it should be noted that many symptomatic LQT1 
and LQT2 patients experience a subsequent cardiac event associated 
with a different trigger. For example, an LQT2 patient first experienc-
ing an arousal event or one during sleep may subsequently have an 
exercise-triggered event. Therefore, beta blocker therapy still remains 
first-line therapy even for patients experiencing a nonexercise-asso-
ciated first event.

In  addition,  intragenotype  risk  stratification  has  been  completed 
for the two most common subtypes of LQTS based on mutation type, 
mutation location, and cellular function.19-22 Patients with LQT1 sec-
ondary to Kv7.1 missense mutations localizing to the transmembrane-
spanning  domains  clinically  have  a  twofold  greater  risk  for  an 
LQT1-triggered cardiac event than do LQT1 patients with mutations 
localizing to the C-terminal region. In addition, missense mutations 
localizing  to  the  so-called  cytoplasmic  loops  (C-loops)  within  the 
transmembrane-spanning domains, an area of the protein involved 
in  the  regulation  of  adrenergic  channels,  are  associated  with  the 
highest  rate  of  both  exercise-  and  arousal-triggered  events  but  not 
with  an  increase  rate  of  sleep/rest-associated  events.15  C-loop  Kv7.1 
missense mutations were consistently associated with greater than a 
sixfold increase in risk for exercise-triggered events in comparison to 
nonmissense mutations and an almost threefold increase in compari-
son to N- and C-terminal missense mutations.15

Patients with mutations resulting in a greater degree of Kv7.1 loss 
of function at the cellular in vitro level (i.e., dominant negative) have 
a twofold greater clinical risk than that of patients with mutations that 
damage the biology of the Kv7.1 channel less severely (haploinsuffi-
ciency). Adding to the traditional clinical risk factors, molecular loca-
tion  and  cellular  function  are  independent  risk  factors  used  in  the

evaluation of patients with LQTS.20 Akin to molecular risk stratifica-
tion  in  LQT1,  patients  with  LQT2  secondary  to  Kv11.1  pore  region 
mutations have a longer QTc and more severe clinical manifestation 
of the disorder and experience significantly more arrhythmia-related 
cardiac events occurring at a younger age than do LQT2 patients with 
nonpore-related mutations in Kv11.1.23 Similarly, in a Japanese cohort 
of LQT2 patients, those with pore mutations had a longer QTc, and 
although  not  significant  among  probands,  nonprobands  with  pore 
mutations experienced their first cardiac event at an earlier age than 
did  those  with  a  nonpore-related  mutation.21  Most  recently,  addi-
tional  information  has  been  gleaned  suggesting  that  LQT2  patients 
with  mutations  involving  the  transmembrane  pore  region  had  the 
greatest risk for cardiac events, those with frameshift/nonsense muta-
tions in any region had intermediate risk, and those with missense 
mutations in the C-terminus had the lowest risk for cardiac events.22 
Interestingly, LQT2 patients with mutations in the pore loop region of 
the  Kv11.1  channel  have  a  greater  than  twofold  increased  risk  for 
arousal-triggered  events,  and  LQT2  patients  with  nonpore  loop 
transmembrane region mutations have an almost sevenfold increase 
in  the  risk  for  exercise-triggered  cardiac  events  over  patients  with 
N-terminal/C-terminal (non-PAS domain) mutations.24

Incomplete  penetrance  and  variable  expressivity  are  the  clinical 
hallmark  features  of  LQTS,  and  it  has  long  been  thought  that 
co-inheritance  of  a  true  disease-causing  mutation  and  either  a 
common or rare channel genetic variant may determine the expressed 
severity  of  the  disorder.  For  example,  coexistence  of  the  common 
K897T-KCNH2  polymorphism  and  the  A1116V-KCNH2  mutation  (on 
opposite alleles) led to a more severe clinical course in a single Italian 
LQTS  family.  The  A1116V  mutation  by  itself  produced  a  subclinical 
phenotype  of  mild  QT  prolongation  and  an  asymptomatic  course, 
whereas  the  proband  hosting  both  variants  had  clinically  overt 

621

disease  consisting  of  diagnostic  QT  prolongation,  presyncope  epi-
sodes,  and  cardiac  arrest.25  Besides  cardiac  ion  channels,  single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of nonion channel genes such as 
NOS1AP  (the  gene  encoding  the  nitric  oxide  synthase  1  adapter 
protein),  ADRA2C  (alpha2C-adrenergic  receptor),  and  ADRB1  (beta1-
adrenergic receptor) may modify disease severity in LQTS.26-29

In 2012, Amin and colleagues provided compelling evidence for a 
strong disease-modifying effect of a 3 untranslated region (3UTR), 
KCNQ1  allelespecific  haplotype  in  LQT1  mutationpositive  pedi-
grees; the magnitude of the effect on the QTc and symptomatology 
goes well beyond any other currently described genetic modifiers.30 
The  KCNQ1  gene  encodes  for  a  single  Kv7.1  ion  channel  alpha 
subunit.  Following  KCNQ1  gene  expression  and  post-translational 
modifications,  four  alpha  subunits  are  assembled  to  create  a  pore-
forming Kv7.1 tetrameric channel. Therefore, if a patient had a hetero-
zygous  KCNQ1  mutation  (i.e.,  one  normal  KCNQ1  gene  allele  and 
one  mutant  allele),  one  would  expect  that  if  both  the  normal  and 
mutant  gene  alleles  were  expressed  in  equal  amounts,  1
16  of  the 
channels  would  be  normal  homomeric  tetramers  and  1
16  would  be 
mutant  homomeric  tetramers.  The  remaining  channels  would  be 
hybrids  containing  both  normal  and  mutant  alpha  subunits.  One 
would  predict  that  if  the  normal  KCNQ1  gene  allele  expression 
was  somehow  suppressed,  there  would  be  relatively  more  KCNQ1 
mutant alpha subunits translated and ultimately assembled to provide 
more dysfunctional KCNQ1 channels and thus lead to a more severe 
manifestation of the disorder (Fig. 32-4). Simply put, far more bad 
(mutant) channels than good (healthy) channels would be created. 
The  opposite  would  be  true  if  the  mutation  containing  the  KCNQ1 
allele were suppressed.

Most genes have a 3UTR that produces an mRNA transcript that 
contains regions of cis-regulatory binding sites for small noncoding

KCNQ1 gene transcriptsuppressing mechanism by the existence of naturally occurring SNPs within the KCNQ1 3UTR whereby the presence of their minor alleles (A, G; blue 
squares) creates a suppressive haplotype by creating new microRNA (shown in red ) binding sites that suppress expression of the KCNQ1 gene allele in which they reside, thus 
altering the stoichiometric assembly of wild-type (i.e., normal, shown in yellow; WT) and mutant (shown in blue; MUT) Kv7.1 alpha subunits. (Modified from Amin AS, Giudicessi

microRNA  (miRNA)  molecules  that  bind  to  the  transcript  and  ulti-
mately  inhibit  that  genes  expression.  Naturally  occurring  genetic 
variation within these 3UTRs (miR-SNPs) can either abolish existing 
or create new miRNA binding sites. Amin and colleagues identified 
three  naturally  occurring  SNPs  (rs2519184,  rs8234,  and  rs10798) 
within the KCNQ1 3UTR whereby the presence of their minor alleles 
(A, G, G) generates a suppressive haplotype by creating new miRNA 
binding  sites  that  suppress  expression  of  the  KCNQ1  gene  allele  in 
which  they  reside.30  In  a  cohort  of  168  KCNQ1  (LQT1)  mutation
positive  individuals  from  41  families,  Amin  and  colleagues  showed 
that  inheritance  of  the  suppressive  haplotype  residing  on  the 
normal  healthy  allele  produced  a  more  severe  LQT1  phenotype 
with regard to QTc and symptomatology than did inheritance of the 
suppressive  haplotype  residing  on  the  same  allele  as  the  KCNQ1 
mutation (shorter QTc and fewer symptoms).30 This intriguing discov-
ery  may  not  only  explain  a  significant  component  of  the  reduced 
penetrance  and  variable  expressivity  that  is  a  common  feature  of 
arrhythmia syndromes but may also represent a paradigm shift in our 
thinking about disease-modifying genetic drivers of mendelian disor-
ders  because  one  of  the  most  important  genetic  determinants  of 
disease severity in LQT1 appears to be the 3UTR KCNQ1 haplotype 
on the allele inherited from the unaffected non-LQTS parent.

In 2011, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart 
Rhythm Association (EHRA) released the first HRS/EHRA-sponsored 
guidelines for clinical genetic testing for LQTS and the other chan-
nelopathies and can be reviewed therein.31

Andersen-TawilSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations  
of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome
ATS, first described in 1971 in a case report by Andersen and later 
described by Tawil in 1994, is now recognized as a rare, multisystem 
disorder characterized by a triad of clinical findings, including peri-
odic  paralysis,  dysmorphic  features,  and  ventricular  arrhythmias.32 
ATS is a heterogeneous disorder that is either sporadically or autoso-
mal dominantly derived and has a high degree of variable phenotypic 
expression  and  incomplete  penetrance,  with  as  many  as  20%  of 
mutation-positive subjects being nonpenetrant.32 The mean age at the 
onset of periodic paralysis has been reported to be 5 years (ranging 
from 8 months to 15 years) and slightly older, 13 years (range, 4 to 
25 years), for cardiac symptoms.32

ECG abnormalities in ATS may include pronounced QTU prolonga-
tion, prominent U waves, and ventricular ectopy, including polymor-
phic  ventricular  tachycardia  (VT),  bigeminy,  and  bidirectional  VT. 
Even though ventricular ectopy is common and ectopic density can 
be high in some patients, most patients with ATS are asymptomatic 
and  SCD  is  extremely  rare.33  ATS1  was  initially  proposed  as  type  7 
LQTS (LQT7) because of the observation of extreme prolongation of 
the  QT  interval;  however,  these  measurements  included  the  promi-
nent  U  wave.34  Accordingly,  this  complex  clinical  disorder,  mani-
fested at times with only a modest prolongation of the QT interval, is 
probably best considered as its own clinical entity and be referred 
to as ATS1 rather than as part of the LQTS regime. However, given the 
potential  for  false  interpretation  of  the  QT  interval  because  of  the 
prominent U wave and the probability of phenotypic expression of 
only  cardiac-derived  symptomatology  (i.e.,  syncope,  palpitations, 
ventricular rhythm disturbances), a considerable number of patients 
with ATS are conceivably misdiagnosed as having classic LQTS. Simi-
larly, the presence of bidirectional VT, an accepted hallmark of CPVT 
(see later), often leads to ATS being misdiagnosed as the potentially 
lethal  disorder  CPVT.  Correctly  distinguishing  between  ATS  and 
CPVT is critical because the treatment strategies are different.35

Genetic  Basis  for  Andersen-Tawil  Syndrome.  To  date,  almost 
40 unique mutations in KCNJ2 have been described as being causative 
of ATS1. Mutations in KCNJ2 account for approximately two thirds of 
cases of ATS, whereas the molecular basis of the residual third of ATS 
cases  remains  genetically  and  mechanistically  elusive.  However,  the 
prevalence  of  KCNJ2  mutations  may  be  as  high  as  75%  in  patients 
with  at  least  two  ATS  phenotypic  features  (i.e.,  typical  ATS).36 

Localized  to  chromosome  17q23,  KCNJ2  encodes  for  Kir2.1,  a  small 
potassium channel alpha subunit expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, 
and heart that is critically responsible for the inward-rectifying cardiac 
IK1  current  (see  Table  32-1  and  Fig.  32-1).  In  the  heart,  IK1  plays  an 
important  role  in  setting  the  hearts  resting  membrane  potential, 
buffering extracellular potassium, and modulating the action potential 
waveform.  Most  KCNJ2  mutations  described  in  ATS  are  missense 
mutations that cause a loss of function of IK1, either through a domi-
nant negative effect on Kir2.1 subunit assembly or through haploin-
sufficiency as a result of protein trafficking defects.37

Genotype-Phenotype Correlates  
in Andersen-Tawil Syndrome
Genotype-specific ECG features of ATS are beginning to emerge. In a 
study by Zhang and colleagues in which T-U ECG morphology was 
examined, 91% of KCNJ2 mutationpositive ATS1 patients had char-
acteristic T-U wave patterns (including a prolonged terminal T wave 
downslope, a wide T-U junction, and biphasic and enlarged U waves) 
as  opposed  to  none  of  the  61  unaffected  family  members  or  29 
genotype-negative  ATS  patients.34  In  a  2012  study  by  Kimura  and 
associates,  88%  of  their  KCNJ2  mutationpositive  ATS  patients  had 
an abnormal U wave.36 Additionally, although the U wave is markedly 
abnormal in ATS1, it is typically normal in LQTS. Consequently, this 
KCNJ2  genespecific  ECG  feature  of  T-U  morphology  can  be  very 
useful in differentiating ATS1 patients from KCNJ2 mutationnegative 
ATS  and  LQT1  to  LQT3  patients  and  may  facilitate  a  cost-effective 
approach  to  genetic  testing  of  the  appropriate  disorder.34  Interest-
ingly, the topologic location of KCNJ2 mutations may influence the 
phenotypic expression of ATS features. The vast majority (90%) of 
KCNJ2  mutations  reside  in  either  the  N-  or  C-terminus  of  this  two-
transmembrane single-pore channel. C-terminal mutations appear to 
be more often associated with typical ATS (more than two ATS fea-
tures),  dysmorphism,  and  periodic  paralysis,  whereas  N-terminal 
mutations were more often observed in atypical ATS cases (only one 
ATS feature, predominately a cardiac phenotype only).36

TimothySyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations  
of Timothy Syndrome
TS is an extremely rare (<30 patients described worldwide) multisys-
tem, highly lethal arrhythmia disorder associated with both cardiac 
and extracardiac abnormalities. The typical cardiac manifestations 
of TS include fetal bradycardia and extreme prolongation of the QT 
interval (QTc >500 msec), often with macroscopic T wave alternans 
and a 2 : 1 atrioventricular (AV) block at birth.38 These abnormalities 
frequently  coincide  with  congenital  heart  defects  or  cardiomyopa-
thies. The extracardiac abnormalities often consist of simple syndac-
tyly  (webbing  of  the  toes  and  fingers),  dysmorphic  facial  features, 
abnormal  dentition,  immune  deficiency,  severe  hypoglycemia,  and 
developmental  delay  (including  autism).38  Currently,  most  patients 
with TS die before reaching puberty. Although most cases of TS have 
been  described  as  sporadic  de  novo  occurrences,  there  have  now 
been a few cases reported with somatic mosaicism that is associated 
with  a  less  severe  phenotype.39  In  such  patients,  for  example,  the 
CACNA1C mutation may be present in skeletal muscle but in only a 
minuscule amount or even completely absent in other types of cell 
in  the  human  body  (i.e.,  absent  in  heart,  blood,  lymphocytes,  and 
other cell types), in which case the patient may have simple syndac-
tyly but not an overt cardiac phenotype.

Genetic  Basis  for  Timothy  Syndrome.  In  2004,  Splawski  and 
colleagues identified the molecular basis for this highly lethal arrhyth-
mia disorder and coined it Timothy syndrome after Katherine Timothy, 
Drs.  Keatings  and  Splawskis  study  coordinator,  who  meticulously 
phenotyped  these  cases.38  Remarkably,  in  all  13  unrelated  patients 
from whom DNA was available, Splawski and coworkers identified the 
same recurrent sporadic de novo missense mutation, G406R, in the 
alternatively spliced exon 8A of the CACNA1C-encoded cardiac LTCC 
(Cav1.2), which is important for excitation-contraction coupling in the 
heart  and,  like  the  cardiac  sodium  channel  SCN5A,  mediates  an

inward depolarizing current in cardiomyocytes (see Table 32-1 and Fig. 
32-1).38  Through  the  mechanism  of  alternative  splicing,  the  human 
LTCC consists of two mutually exclusive isoforms, one containing exon 
8A  and  the  other  containing  exon  8.  A  year  later,  Splawski  and 
coworkers described two cases of atypical TS (TS2) with similar fea-
tures of TS yet without syndactyly. As with other TS cases, these two 
atypical cases were identified as having sporadic de novo CACNA1C 
mutations not in exon 8A but rather in exon 8. One patient hosted a 
mutation analogous to the classic TS mutation G406R, whereas the 
other hosted a G402R missense mutation.40 All three mutations confer 
gain  of  function  to  the  LTCCs  through  impaired  channel  inactiva-
tion38,40  and  reside  very  near  the  end  of  the  S6  transmembrane 
segment  of  domain  I  in  the  beginning  of  the  intracellular  loop   
between domains I and II of the Cav1.2 alpha subunit. In 2012, Gillis 
and  associates  identified  a  novel  CACNA1C  mutation,  A1473G,  in  a 
single  patient  with  a  prolonged  QT  interval,  dysmorphic  facial  fea-
tures, syndactyly, and joint contractures consistent with TS.41 Although 
this  mutation  has  not  yet  been  functionally  characterized,  interest-
ingly,  its  topologic  position  (a  few  amino  acids  away  from  the  S6 
transmembrane segment of domain IV) in the channel architecture is 
very  similar  to  the  position  of  the  three  original  TS  mutations  (S6 
segment of domain I).

Short-QTSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations  
of Short-QT Syndrome
Short-QT  syndrome  (SQTS),  first  described  in  2000  by  Gussak  and 
colleagues, is associated with a short QT interval (usually 320 msec) 
on  a  12-lead  ECG,  paroxysmal  atrial  fibrillation,  syncope,  and 
increased risk for SCD.42 Giustetto and coauthors analyzed the clini-
cal  features  of  53  patients  with  SQTS  from  29  families,  the  largest 
cohort studied to date, and found that 62% of the patients were symp-
tomatic, with cardiac arrest being the most common symptom (31% 
of patients) and frequently the first manifestation of the disorder.43 A 
fourth of the patients had a history of syncope, and almost 30% had 
a  family  history  of  SCD.  Symptoms,  including  syncope  or  cardiac 
arrest, occurred most often during periods of rest or sleep. Almost a 
third had atrial fibrillation.43 SCD was observed during infancy, thus 
suggesting  a  potential  role  for  SQTS  as  a  rare  pathogenic  basis  for 
some cases of SIDS.42

Genetic Basis for Short-QT Syndrome.  SQTS is most often inher-
ited  in  an  autosomal  dominant  manner;  however,  some  de  novo 
sporadic cases have been described. To date, mutations in six genes 
(see  Table  32-1)  have  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  SQTS, 
including  gain-of-function  mutations  in  the  potassium  channel
encoding genes KCNH2 (SQT1), KCNQ1 (SQT2), and KCNJ2 (SQT3) and 
loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1C (SQT4), CACNB2b (SQT5), and 
CACNA2D1 (SQT6), which encode for the LTCC alpha, beta, and delta 
subunits,  respectively  (see  Table  32-1  and  Fig.  32-1).42,44,45  However, 
despite identification of these six SQTS susceptibility genes, it remains 
unknown what proportion of SQTS is expected to be SQT1 to SQT6 
genotype positive and what proportion awaits genetic elucidation. It 
is  estimated  that  more  than  75%  of  SQTS  cases  remain  genetically 
elusive.

Genotype-Phenotype Correlates in Short-QT Syndrome
Even  though  data  are  insufficient  to  clearly  define  genotype-
phenotype correlations in SQTS, with probably fewer than 60 cases 
having  been  described  in  the  literature  to  date,  gene-specific  ECG 
patterns are beginning to emerge. The typical ECG pattern consists 
of a QT interval of 320 milliseconds or less (QTc 340 msec) and tall, 
peaked T waves in the precordial leads with either no or a short ST 
segment. The T waves tend to be symmetric in SQT1 but asymmetric 
in  SQT2  to  SQT4.  In  SQT2,  inverted  T  waves  can  be  observed.  In  
SQT5,  a  BrS-like  ST  elevation  in  the  right  precordial  lead  may  be 
observed.42

Despite  perhaps  being  premature  because  of  a  small  sample  
size,  a  recent  report  has  suggested  that  SQTS  patients  with  KCNH2 
mutations  have  a  shorter  QT  interval  and  a  greater  response  to  
hydroquinidine  therapy  than  do  patients  with  a  non-KCNH2
mediated SQTS.46

Drug-InducedTorsadesdePointes
Clinical Description and Manifestations of Drug-Induced 
Torsades de Pointes
Drug-induced  QT  prolongation  and/or  drug-induced  torsades  de 
pointes  (DI-TdP)  are  a  constant  concern  for  physicians  prescribing 
particular drugs with the capacity for producing such unwanted and 
potentially life-threatening side effects (see Chapters 9 and 37). The 
estimated incidence of antiarrhythmic druginduced TdP has ranged 
from 1% to 8%, depending on the drug and dose.47 DI-TdP and subse-
quent sudden death are rare events; however, the list of potential QT 
liability or torsadegenic drugs is extensive and includes not only 
antiarrhythmic  drugs  such  as  quinidine,  sotalol,  and  dofetilide  but 
also  many  noncardiac  medications  such  as  antipsychotics,  metha-
done, antimicrobials, antihistamines, and the gastrointestinal stimu-
lant cisapride (see www.qtdrugs.org for a comprehensive list).48

IKr Channel Blockers and the Repolarization Reserve
In  addition  to  their  intended  function  and  their  intended  target  of 
action,  the  vast  majority  of  medications  with  a  potential  unwanted 
TdP-predisposing  side  effect  are  IKr/Kv11.1  channel  blockers  (also 
referred to as HERG channel blockers). In effect, QT-prolonging drugs 
create an LQT2-like phenotype through reduced repolarization effi-
ciency and subsequent lengthening of the cardiac action potential.49 
However,  IKr  drug  blockade  alone  does  not  appear  sufficient  to 
provide  the  potentially  lethal  TdP  substrate.  One  particular  thesis 
centers on the observation that cardiac repolarization relies on the 
interaction of several ion currents that provide some level of redun-
dancy in protecting against extreme QT prolongation by QT liability 
drugs.47 This so-called repolarization reserve may be reduced through 
anomalies  in  the  repolarization  machinery,  namely,  as  a  result  of 
common or rare genetic variants in critical ion channels that produce 
subclinical loss of the repolarizing currents IKs and IKr.47 In fact, recent 
studies  have  revealed  that  10%  to  15%  of  patients  with  DI-TdP  host 
rare ion channel mutations.50 A smaller study found potential LQTS 
susceptibility mutations in 40% of cases of seemingly isolated, drug-
induced LQTS.51 Moreover, functional characterization of these muta-
tions  suggested  that  they  were  somewhat  weaker  than  the 
loss-of-function mutations associated with classic, autosomal domi-
nant LQTS, thus furthering the multiple-hit hypothesis that underlies 
the reduced repolarization reserve.

Common Ion Channel Polymorphisms and Drug-Induced Tors-
ades de Pointes.  Among the common polymorphisms of the KCNH2-
encoding IKr potassium channel, the K897T and R1047L polymorphisms 
have  received  the  most  attention  (see  Chapter  9).  As  noted  in  the 
review  by  Fitzgerald  and  Ackerman,48  Paavonen  and  associates 
observed that T897-KCNH2 channels exhibit slower activation kinetics 
with a higher degree of inactivation, an alteration expected to decrease 
channel  function  and  perhaps  alter  drug  sensitivity  because  several 
commonly used drugs that inhibit IKr channel function bind preferen-
tially to the inactivated state of the channel. These data suggest that 
T897 channels may genetically reduce the repolarization reserve and 
facilitate a proarrhythmic response that may be enhanced in the setting 
of  IKr  channelblocking  drugs  when  compared  with  wild-type  K897 
channels. In fact, K897T appears to affect the QTc response to ibutilide 
in a sex-specific manner. In a study by Sun and colleagues, as noted in 
a review by Schullze-Bahr,13 among 105 patients with atrial fibrillation 
treated with dofetilide, R1047L was overrepresented in those in whom 
DI-TdP developed in comparison to patients who were free of TdP. As 
well  as  these  common  potassium  channel  alpha  subunit  polymor-
phisms,  three  common  polymorphisms  (D85N-KCNE1,  T8A-KCNE2, 
and Q9E-KCNE2) involving auxiliary beta subunits have been implicated 
in drug-induced susceptibility to arrhythmia.48

In addition to genetic variants in major repolarizing channels, vari-
ants of the major depolarizing channel Nav1.5 may provide a substrate 
for a proarrhythmic response in the setting of IKr-blocking drugs or in 
patients with other risk factors for DI-TdP. The most prominent channel 
polymorphism  conferring  susceptibility  to  arrhythmia  in  an  ethnic-
specific manner is S1103Y-SCN5A (originally annotated as the Y1102 
variant). This polymorphism, seen in 13% of black Americans but not 
observed in any white or Asian controls (>1000 subjects), was over-
represented  in  arrhythmia  cases  (56.5%)  in  comparison  to  controls 
(13%) involving black Americans (odds ratio = 8.7).47 S1103Y has been

found to produce subtle alterations in channel kinetics in heterologous 
expression  studies  when  studied  under  basal  conditions.  However, 
functional and modeling studies have supported the potential for QT 
prolongation, reactivation of calcium channels early after depolariza-
tion, and arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of concomitant expo-
sure to IKr-blocking drugs.

Recent genome-wide association studies have associated common 
variants  of  the  NOS1AP-encoded  nitric  oxide  synthase  1  adapter 
protein with QT interval duration. NOS1AP is a regulator of neuronal 
nitric  oxide  synthase  (nNOS),  which  regulates  intracellular  calcium 
levels and myocyte contraction through its effect on LTCCs. Common 
SNPs in NOS1AP appear to be associated with drug-induced QT pro-
longation  and  ventricular  arrhythmia.52  This  association  was  most 
pronounced in patients taking amiodarone, currently one of the most 
common antiarrhythmic drugs. It has been hypothesized that genetic 
variants in NOS1AP that suppress expression of the gene may in turn 
result in increased LTCC currents and subsequent QT prolongation and 
that  individuals  with  such  variants  may  be  at  increased  arrhythmo-
genic risk while taking amiodarone.52 However, although QT prolon-
gation  is  observed  routinely  with  amiodarone,  DI-TdP  attributed  to 
amiodarone is exceedingly rare.

Additionally, genetic variation or individual differences in drug elimi-
nation or metabolism may contribute to individual risk for DI-TdP. For 
example,  patients  with  a  genetically  mediated  reduction  in  CYP3A 
enzymatic activity could be vulnerable to DI-TdP in the setting of IKr 
blockers  that  depend  on  the  cytochrome  P-450  enzyme  CYP3A  for 
its metabolism.13

THEOTHERCHANNELOPATHIES

premature ven tricular complexes in bigeminy are far more likely than 
the more specific but less sensitive finding of bidirectional VT.56 CPVT is 
associated with a structurally normal heart. Once thought to be mani-
fested only during childhood, more recent studies have suggested that 
age at onset can range from infancy to 40 years. The potential lethality 
of CPVT is illustrated by mortality rates of 30% to 50% by the age of 35 
years and the presence of a positive family history of young (<40 years) 
SCD in more than a third of individuals with CPVT and in as many as 
60% of families hosting RyR2 mutations.53 Moreover, approximately 15% 
of autopsy-negative cases of SUD in the young and some cases of SIDS 
have been attributed to CPVT.2,57

Genetic Basis for Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular 
Tachycardia.  Perturbations in key components of intracellular calcium-
induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum serve as the 
pathogenic basis for CPVT (see Chapter 33). Inherited in an autosomal 
dominant fashion, mutations in the RyR2-encoded cardiac ryanodine 
receptor/calcium release channel represent the most common genetic 
subtype of CPVT (CPVT1); such mutations account for 60% of clinically 
strong cases of CPVT (Fig. 32-5; also see Table 32-1). Gain-of-func-
tion mutations in RyR2 lead to leaky calcium release channels, which 
results in excessive release of calcium, particularly during sympathetic 
stimulation, that can precipitate calcium overload, delayed depolariza-
tions, and ventricular arrhythmias.53 Again, most unrelated CPVT fami-
lies are found to have their own unique RyR2 mutations, and about 5% 
of unrelated mutation-positive patients host multiple putative patho-
genic mutations.58

RyR2 is one of the largest genes in the human genome, with 105 
exons that transcribe/translate one of the largest cardiac ion channel 
proteins consisting of 4967 amino acid residues. Although there do not 
appear to be any specific mutation hot spots, there are three regional 
hot spots or domains in which unique mutations reside (see Fig. 32-5). 
This observation has lent itself toward targeted genetic testing for RyR2

FIGURE32-5  CPVT: a disorder of intracellular calcium handling. Perturbations in key components of the calcium-induced cal-
cium release (CICR) mechanism responsible for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling are the pathogenic basis for CPVT. At the 
center of this mechanism is the RyR2-encoded cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel located in the membrane of the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in RyR2 are clustered and distributed in three hot spot regions of this 4967amino acid (AA) 
protein: domain I or the N-terminal domain (AA 57 to 1141), domain II or the central domain (AA 1638 to 2579), and domain III or

(61 exons) rather than a comprehensive 105-exon scan. More than 
90%  of  the  RyR2  mutations  discovered  to  date  represent  missense 
mutations; however, perhaps as many as 5% of unrelated CPVT patients 
host large gene rearrangements consistent with large whole-exon dele-
tions, akin to what has been observed in LQTS.58 Even though genotype-
phenotype correlations are very limited to date, a recent publication has 
suggested  that  family  members  hosting  C-terminal  (ion  channel
forming domain) RyR2 mutations may have a higher ventricular arrhyth-
mia burden of nonsustained VT than individuals hosting N-terminal or 
central domain RyR2-localizing mutations.59

Strikingly,  nearly  a  third  of  possible/atypical  patients  with  LQTS 
(QTc <480 msec) and exertion-induced syncope have also been identi-
fied  as  RyR2-mutation  positive.58  In  fact,  it  has  been  reported  that 
almost 30% of patients with CPVT have been misdiagnosed as having 
LQTS with normal QT intervals or concealed LQTS, thus indicating 
the critical importance of properly distinguishing between CPVT and 
LQTS at the clinical level because risk assessments and treatment strate-
gies  for  these  unique  disorders  may  vary.  Similarly,  some  patients  in 
whom CPVT is diagnosed based on the presence of bidirectional VT 
during  exercise  have  been  identified  with  KCNJ2  mutations  that  are 
associated  with  the  rarely  lethal  ATS.35  Misdiagnosis  of  ATS  as  the 
potentially lethal disorder CPVT may lead to more aggressive prophy-
lactic therapy (i.e., cardioverter-defibrillator implantation) than neces-
sary. Two autosomal recessive forms of CPVT have been identified that 
involve mutations in either the CASQ2-encoded calsequestrin-2 protein 
or TRDN-encoded triadin.60,61 Most recently, mutations in calmodulin-1 
(CALM1)  have  been  implicated  as  a  cause  of  autosomal  dominant 
CPVT; a single missense mutation was identified that segregated with 
a CPVT phenotype in a large Swedish pedigree (see Table 32-1).62

BrugadaSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations  
of Brugada Syndrome
BrS  is  an  heritable  arrhythmia  syndrome  characterized  by  an  ECG 
pattern  consisting  of  coved-type  ST-segment  elevation  (2 mm)  fol-
lowed by a negative T wave in the right precordial leads V1 through V3 
(often referred to as a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern) and increased risk 
for sudden death resulting from episodes of polymorphic ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias.63,64 The penetrance and expressivity of the disorder 
are highly variable and range from life-long asymptomatic individuals 
to SCD during the first year of life. BrS is generally considered a disor-
der  that  involves  young  male  adults,  perhaps  greatest  in  Southeast 
Asian males, with arrhythmogenic manifestations first arising at an 
average age of 40 years and sudden death typically occurring during 
sleep.65,66 In fact, sudden unexplained nocturnal death in young males 
is endemic in Southeast Asia and is now considered phenotypically, 
genetically, and functionally the same disorder as BrS.64 However, BrS 
has also been demonstrated in children and infants.67 In a 2007 popula-
tion study of 30 children (<16 years of age) affected by BrS from 26 
families, fever was the most common precipitating factor for arrhyth-
mic cardiac events, including syncope and SCD.67

Genetic  Basis  for  Brugada  Syndrome.  BrS  is  inherited  as  an 
autosomal dominant trait; however, more than half of BrS cases may 
be sporadic. Approximately 20% to 30% of BrS cases stem from loss-
of-function mutations in the SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel 
(see Table 32-1 and Fig. 32-1) and are classified as Brugada syndrome 
type 1 (BrS1). In 2010, an international compendium of SCN5A muta-
tions in patients referred for BrS genetic testing reported almost 300 
distinct mutations in 438 of 2111 (21%) unrelated patients, and the 
mutation  detection  yield  ranged  from  11%  to  28%  across  nine 
centers.68 The yield of mutation detection may be significantly higher 
with familial forms than with sporadic cases. Schulze-Bahr and cowork-
ers identified SCN5A mutations in 38% of their familial BrS cases as 
opposed to none in 27 sporadic cases (P = 0.001).69 Most of the muta-
tions were missense (66%), followed by frameshift (13%), nonsense, 
(11%), splice site (7%), and in-frame deletions/insertions (3%). Approxi-
mately 3% of genotype-positive patients host multiple putative patho-
genic SCN5A mutations, and like the genotype-phenotype observations 
in  LQTS,6  patients  hosting  multiple  SCN5A  mutations  tend  to  be 
younger at diagnosis (29.7  16 years) than those with a single muta-
tion (39.2  14.4 years).68 Again, as with LQTS, there is no particular 
mutational  hot  spot,  with  almost  80%  of  the  BrS-related  SCN5A 
mutations  occurring  as  private  single-family  mutations.  However,

almost 10% of the 438 unrelated, SCN5A mutationpositive patients 
hosted one of four mutations: E1784K (14 patients), F861WfsX90 (11 
patients), D356N (8 patients), and G1408R (7 patients).68 Interestingly, 
the most commonly occurring BrS1 mutation, E1784K, has also been 
reported  to  be  the  most  commonly  seen  LQT3-associated  SCN5A 
mutation,  thus  illustrating  how  the  same  exact  DNA  alteration  in  a 
given  gene  can  lead  to  two  distinct  cardiac  arrhythmia  syndromes, 
most  likely  as  a  result  of  other  environmental  or  genetic  modifying 
factors.  In  fact,  E1784K  represents  the  quintessential  example  of  a 
cardiac sodium channel mutation with the capacity to provide a mixed 
clinical phenotype of LQT3, BrS, and conduction disorders.70

In addition to pathogenic mutations in SCN5A, common polymor-
phisms may have a modifying effect on the disorder. As noted in the 
review by Antzelevitch and Nof,71 Bezzina and colleagues described an 
Asian-specific  haplotype  of  six  SCN5A  promoter  polymorphisms  in 
nearly  complete  linkage  disequilibrium  that  occurred  with  an  allelic 
frequency of 22% and was comparatively absent in whites and blacks. 
These promoter region polymorphisms may modulate the variability in 
cardiac conduction and in part contribute to the higher prevalence of 
BrS observed in the Asian population. Brugada and coauthors provided 
data supporting the common polymorphism H558R as a modulator of 
the BrS phenotype, with the minor allele R558 providing a less severe 
clinical course in their 75 genotyped patients with BrS.64 Patients homo-
zygous for H558 had a longer QRS complex duration in lead II, higher J 
point elevation in lead V2, and a higher aVR sign and tended to have 
more symptoms than H558R heterozygotes or R558 homozygotes.64

Mutations have now been discovered in 13 BrS susceptibility genes 
in addition to SCN5A (see Table 32-1). Mechanistically, either decreases 
in the inward sodium or calcium currents or increases in the outward 
Kv4.3 potassium current produce the BrS phenotype through pertur-
bation  of  either  the  respective  channel  alpha  subunits  or  channel-
interacting  proteins  (see  Fig.  32-1).65  For  example,  mutations  in  the 
glycerol-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  1like  protein  encoded  by 
GPD1L affect trafficking of the sodium channel to the plasma mem-
brane, thus reducing the overall sodium current and giving rise to the 
BrS  phenotype,72  whereas  mutations  involving  the  LTCC  alpha  and 
beta subunits encoded by the CACNA1C and CACNB2b genes, respec-
tively, were implicated in approximately 10% of BrS cases.73 However, 
on closer examination of this seminal discovery, a tight link between 
calcium channelmediated disease and the clinical phenotype of BrS 
with a concomitant short QT interval is evident, with 50% of patients 
with BrS/short QT interval hosting a mutation in the LTCC subunit. In 
fact, in 2012, Crotti and colleagues performed the first comprehensive 
mutational analysis of a large cohort of unrelated patients with BrS, 
and although they identified SCN5A mutations in 16% of the cohort, 
only 1.5% of the BrS cases had a mutation in one of the LTCC subunit 
genes in the absence of a short QT interval.74 Importantly, the genetic 
cause  of  more  than  two  thirds  of  clinically  diagnosed  cases  of  BrS 
remains elusive, thus suggesting a high degree of genetic heterogene-
ity for this disorder. This degree of genetic elusiveness also begs the 
question of whether most BrS is a genetically heterogeneous mono-
genic  disorder  or  in  fact  a  congenital  heart  defect/developmental 
disorder involving the epicardial right ventricular outflow tract.75

Genotype-Phenotype Correlates in Brugada Syndrome
Because most BrS cases are genetically elusive, genotype-phenotype 
correlations in BrS have not been analyzed to the same degree as in 
LQTS.  SCN5A  mutations  are  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of 
conduction abnormalities in patients with BrS, and the presence of 
a  long  PQ  interval  may  be  indicative  of  SCN5A-mediated  BrS1, 
whereas the presence of a short QT interval (QTc <350 msec) may be 
indicative of LTCC-mediated BrS pathology. In fact, Crotti and coau-
thors  reported  that  although  fewer  than  10%  of  patients  with  a  PQ 
interval of less than 200 milliseconds had a positive SCN5A genetic 
test, the yield was almost 40% in patients with a PQ interval of 200 
milliseconds  or  more.74  Interestingly,  young  males  with  BrS  (<20 
years, 83%) had a significantly higher SCN5A mutation detection rate 
than  did  males  aged  20  to  40  years  (21%)  and  those  older  than  40 
years (11%, P < 0.0001).74 In addition, patients with BrS1 and nonsense, 
frameshift,  or  premature  truncationcausing  mutations  exhibited  a 
more severe phenotype.76 Unlike genetic testing for LQTS, in which 
the triad of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic impact has been 
fulfilled, genetic testing for BrS is currently limited by its lower yield 
(25% for BrS versus 75% for LQTS) and relative absence of a thera-
peutic contribution from knowledge of the genotype.31,77

EarlyRepolarizationSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations of Early 
Repolarization Syndrome
The  early  repolarization  (ER)  pattern  is  characterized  by  the  ECG 
finding of elevation (1 mm above baseline) of the QRS-ST junction 
(the so-called J point) manifested as either QRS slurring (at the transi-
tion of the QRS to the ST segment) or notching (a positive deflection 
inscribed on the terminal S wave), ST-segment elevation with upper 
concavity, and prominent T waves in two or more contiguous leads.78 
The prevalence of the ER pattern in the general population has been 
reported to range from less than 1% to 13%, depending on age, sex, 
race, and the criteria for J point elevation.78 This ECG phenomenon 
has long been considered an innocuous variant in healthy individu-
als. However, Haissaguerre and colleagues noted that J point eleva-
tion  (1 mm  above  baseline)  on  inferolateral  ECG  leads  was 
significantly overrepresented (31%) and greater in magnitude in 206 
case  subjects  who  experienced  cardiac  arrest  secondary  to  idio-
pathic  ventricular  fibrillation  (IVF)  than  in  412  controls  (5%,  P  < 
0.001)  matched  for  age,  sex,  race,  and  level  of  physical  activity.79 
Patients with ER were more often males and had a personal history 
of syncope or cardiac arrest during sleep than did those without an 
ER pattern.79 Similarly, Rosso and associates saw an overrepresenta-
tion of J point elevation in their 45 patients with IVF in comparison 
to controls (45% versus 13%, P = 0.001), with the same observation of 
a male preponderance in those with ER.80

In  a  community-based  general  population  of  10,864  middle-aged 
(30  to  59  years  old,  52%  male)  Finnish  subjects,  Tikkanen  and  col-
leagues identified 630 subjects overall (5.8%) with a J point elevation 
of  at  least  0.1  mV.81  The  overall  prevalence  of  the  ER  pattern  was 
reduced to just 0.33% when considering a J point elevation of 0.2 mV 
or higher. After a 30-year follow-up with the endpoint being cardiac 
death,  Tikkanen  and  colleagues  noted  that  when  compared  with 
subjects  without  a  J  point  elevation,  subjects  with  ER  (J  point 0.1 
mV)  in  the  inferior  leads  had  an  increased  risk  for  both  cardiac  
death  (adjusted  relative  risk  [ARR]  =  1.28;  95%  confidence  interval 
[CI] = 1.04 to 1.59; P = 0.03) and arrhythmias (ARR = 1.43; 95% CI = 
1.06 to 1.94; P = 0.03) and that this risk was further elevated (cardiac 
death ARR = 2.98; 95% CI = 1.85 to 4.92; P < 0.001; arrhythmia ARR = 
2.92; 95% CI = 1.45 to 5.89; P < 0.001) with increasing elevation (0.2 
mV)  of  the  J  point.  However,  an  ER  pattern  localizing  to  only  the 
lateral leads did not show a statistically significant association with 
increased risk for arrhythmic cardiac death.81 Obviously, the vexing 
clinical conundrum with respect to this inferolateral early repolariza-
tion syndrome (ERS) is that of distinguishing potentially lethal ERS 
from the all too often observed juvenile ER pattern seen in healthy 
subjects, particularly healthy athletes.

Genetic Basis for Early Repolarization Syndrome.  The inclina-
tion for a genetic basis for ERS stems from Haissaguerre and colleagues 
observation that 16% of their patients with IVF and an ER pattern had 
a family history of SUD.79 The first gene to be implicated in ERS was 
described by Haissaguere and associates, who reported finding a rare, 
functionally uncharacterized, missense mutation (S422L) in the KCNJ8-
encoding pore-forming subunit Kir6.1 of the adenosine triphosphate
sensitive potassium channel in a 14-year-old girl with IVF.82 Since then, 
this same mutation has been described in additional cases of BrS and 
ERS and has been shown to have a gain of function in electrophysi-
ologic phenotype.83,84 In 2010, Burashnikov and colleagues implicated 
the  LTCC  alpha-1  (CACNA1C),  beta-2  (CACNB2b),  and  alpha-2-delta 
(CACNA2D1) subunitencoding genes in the pathogenesis of ERS with 
their identification of mutations in 4 of 24 (16.7%) ERS index cases85; 
however, not all these genetic variants have been characterized func-
tionally, and some may represent a rare VUS.

ProgressiveCardiacConductionDisease
Clinical Description and Manifestations of Progressive 
Cardiac Conduction Disease
Cardiac  conduction  disease  (CCD)  causes  a  potentially 
life-
threatening  alteration  in  normal  impulse  propagation  through  the 
cardiac  conduction  system.  CCD  can  be  a  result  of  a  number  of 

physiologic mechanisms ranging from acquired to congenital, with 
or without structural heart disease. Progressive cardiac conduction 
disease  (PCCD),  also  known  as  Lev-Lengre  disease,  is  one  of  the 
most  common  cardiac  conduction  disturbances  in  the  absence  of 
structural heart disease and is characterized by a progressive (age-
related) alteration in impulse propagation through the His-Purkinje 
system, with right or left bundle branch block and widening of the 
QRS complex leading to complete AV block, syncope, and occasion-
ally sudden death.66

Genetic  Basis  for  Progressive  Cardiac  Conduction  Disease.  As 
noted in a review by Raun and associates,66 Schott and coworkers further 
expanded the spectrum of loss-of-function SCN5A disease in 1999 with 
the inclusion of familial PCCD. They identified a splice site SCN5A muta-
tion (c.3963+2 T>C) associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance 
pattern in a large French family. Since then, investigators have identified 
more than 30 PCCD-associated mutations in SCN5A; additionally, muta-
tions in SCN1B can cause BrS with conduction disease. These mutations 
result in a loss-of-function phenotype through reduced current density 
and enhanced slow inactivation of the channel. As with most loss-of-
function  SCN5A  diseases,  the  phenotypic  expression  of  PCCD  can  be 
complex  and  is  often  accompanied  by  a  concomitant  BrS  or  BrS-like 
phenotype.  In  fact,  Probst  and  coworkers  showed  that  PCCD  is  the 
prevailing  phenotype  in  BrS-associated  SCN5A  mutation  carriers,  in 
whom the penetrance of conduction defects was 76%.67

In  2009,  Meregalli  and  colleagues  demonstrated  that  the  SCN5A 
mutation  type  can  have  a  profound  effect  on  the  severity  of  PCCD 
and BrS.76 Studying 147 individuals hosting one of 32 different SCN5A 
mutations, Meregalli and coworkers found that patients with either a 
premature truncation mutation (MT, i.e., nonsense or frameshift) or a 
severe  loss-of-function  missense  mutation  (Minactive, >90%  reduction 
in peak INa) had a significantly longer PR interval than did patients with 
missense  mutations  causing  less  impairment  of  the  sodium  current 
(Mactive,  90%  reduction).  Furthermore,  patients  with  a  truncation 
mutation had significantly more episodes of syncope than did those 
with  an  active  mutation  (Mactive).76  These  data  suggest  that  muta-
tions  with  more  deleterious  loss  of  sodium  current  produce  a  more 
severe phenotype of syncope and conduction defect, thus providing 
the first evidence for intragenotype risk stratification associated with 
SCN5A loss-of-function disease.

Most  recently,  gain-of-function  mutations  (E7K,  R164W,  A432T, 
and  G844D)  in  the  TRPM4-encoded  transient  receptor  potential 
melastatin  type  4  ion  channel  have  been  implicated  as  a  cause  of 
autosomal dominant isolated CCD and progressive familial heart block 
type 1 (PFHB1) following linkage analysis and subsequent mutational 
analysis of TRPM4 in four different large multigenerational pedigrees, 
thus  identifying  an  essential  role  for  calcium-activated  nonselective 
cation channel activity in the cardiac conduction system.86,87

When CCD is associated with a concomitant LQTS phenotype, the 
QRS interval is usually narrow and the conduction defect is commonly 
an intermittent 2 : 1 AV block. Patients with LQT2, TS1, or ATS1 may 
also have dysfunctional AV conduction.

SickSinusSyndrome
Clinical Description and Manifestations  
of Sick Sinus Syndrome
Sinus  node  dysfunction  (SND)  or  sick  sinus  syndrome  (SSS)  mani-
fested as inappropriate sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, atrial standstill, 
tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, or chronotropic incompetence is 
the principal reason for pacemaker implantation and has been attrib-
uted to dysfunction of the sinoatrial (SA) node37,66 (see Chapter 37). 
SSS commonly occurs in the elderly (1 in 600 cardiac patients >65 
years) with acquired cardiac conditions, including cardiomyopathy, 
congestive  heart  failure,  ischemic  heart  disease,  or  metabolic  dis-
eases. However, a significant number of patients have no identifiable 
cardiac anomalies or cardiac conditions underlying their sinus node 
dysfunction (idiopathic SND), which can occur at any age, including 
in  utero.37  Additionally,  familial  forms  of  idiopathic  SND  consistent 
with autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance and 
recessive forms with complete penetrance have been reported.66

Genetic  Basis  for  Sick  Sinus  Syndrome.  Mutational  analysis  of 
small cohorts and case reports of patients with idiopathic SSS have thus 
far implicated three genes: SCN5A, HCN4, and ANKB (see Table 32-1). 
To date, 15 SSS-associated mutations have been reported in SCN5A.66,88 

The mutations produced either nonfunctional sodium channels through 
loss  of  expression  or  channels  with  mild  to  severe  loss  of  function 
through an altered biophysical mechanism of the channel.88 As noted 
in a review by Raun and associates,66 in 2003, basing their work on 
previous  observations  of  arrhythmias  and  conduction  disturbances, 
Benson and colleagues examined SCN5A as a candidate gene for con-
genital SSS in 10 pediatric patients from seven families in whom SSS 
was  diagnosed  during  the  first  decade  of  life.  They  identified  com-
pound heterozygote mutations (T220I + R1623X, P1298L + G1408R, 
and  delF1617  +  R1632H)  in  five  individuals  from  three  of  the  seven 
families, thus implicating SCN5A in autosomal recessive SSS. Not sur-
prisingly,  many  of  the  SCN5A-positive  patients  displayed  a  mixed 
phenotype consisting of SSS, BrS, and/or CCD. The expressivity of the 
mixed  phenotype  can  be  highly  variable  within  affected  families.  In 
2007, the case of a 12-year-old boy with SSS, CCD, and recurrent VT 
was presented. The patient was identified with an L1821fsX10 frame-
shift  mutation  that  displayed  a  unique  channel  phenotype  of  90% 
reduced current density (consistent with BrS/SSS/CCD), yet an increase 
in the late sodium current relative to the peak current (consistent with 
LQT3) in the channels that are expressed. As illustrated by this family, 
in which the mutation was present in six asymptomatic family members 
and  two  displayed  only  mild  ECG  phenotypes,  this  disorder  is  often 
associated with incomplete or low penetrance.

Two  loss-of-function  mutations  in  the  hyperpolarization-activated 
cyclic nucleotidegated channel 4 gene HCN4 have been identified in 
two cases of idiopathic SND. The HCN4 gene encodes the so-called 
If  or  pacemaker  current  and  plays  a  key  role  in  automaticity  of  the 
sinus  node.  In  one  study,  a  heterozygous  single  nucleotide  deletion 
(c.1631delC)  creating  a  frameshift  mutation  (P544fsX30)  with  early 
truncation  of  the  protein  was  identified  in  a  patient  with  idiopathic 
SND, and in a second study, another patient with idiopathic SND had 
a missense mutation (D553N) that results in abnormal trafficking of 
the pacemaker channel.89 Interestingly, although the frameshift muta-
tion  identified  in  a  66-year-old  woman  produced  a  mild  phenotype 
associated  with  sinus  rhythm  during  exercise,  the  D553N  missense 
mutation  identified  in  a  43-year-old  woman  was  associated  with 
severe bradycardia, recurrent syncope, QT prolongation, and polymor-
phic  VT  (TdP),  thus  suggesting  the  potential  for  lethality  in  HCN4-
mediated  disease.89  Whether  the  preliminary  10%  to  15%  yield  of 
defective  HCN4-encoded  pacemaker  channels  in  idiopathic  SND 
derived  from  the  two  small  cohorts  is  durable  will  require  further 
studies involving much larger cohorts.

In  2008,  Le  Scouarnec  and  coauthors  reported  the  genetic  and 
molecular mechanism involving ANK2 (also known as ANKB)-encoded 
ankyrin-B  in  two  large  families  with  highly  penetrant  and  severe 
SND.90  Ankyrin-B  is  essential  for  normal  membrane  organization  of 
the ion channels and transporters in cardiocytes within the SA node 
and is required for proper physiologic cardiac pacing. Dysfunction of 
the  ankyrin-Bbased  trafficking  pathway  causes  abnormal  electrical 
activity  in  the  SA  node  and  SND.90  Similar  to  the  sodium  channel, 
variants in ANK2 cause a variety of cardiac dysfunctions.

CONCLUSIONS

This relatively new discipline of the heritable arrhythmia syndromes/
cardiac  channelopathies  has  exploded  over  the  past  decade.  The 
pathogenic insights into the molecular underpinnings for nearly all 
these  syndromes  have  matured  through  the  entire  continuum  of 
research  from  discovery,  translation,  and  most  recently,  incorpora-
tion  into  clinical  practice.  This  bench-to-bedside  maturation  now 
requires learned interpretation of the available genetic tests for these 
syndromes and a clear understanding of the diagnostic, prognostic, 
and therapeutic implications associated with genetic testing for these 
channelopathies.

FUTUREPERSPECTIVES

The emergence of next-generation sequencing platforms and systems 
biology bioinformatics algorithms is providing new tools to efficiently 
interrogate  an  individuals  entire  genome  or  exome  (entire  amino 
acidencoding region of the genome) in a single reaction. This highly 
proficient technology effectively provides a list of every single nucleo-
tide  substitution  and  small  insertion/deletion  (common  or  rare,

benign  or  pathogenic)  for  every  gene  in  a  patients  genome  and  is 
crucial for the current and next phase of new gene discovery within 
even small currently  genotype-negative pedigrees. It  is through the 
current advanced sequencing technologies and systems biology bio-
informatics algorithms and those on the horizon that we will soon be 
able to close the genetic gap in our understanding of these potentially 
lethal yet highly treatable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes.

In addition, recent advances in cellular programming have provided 
new avenues for understanding the cause of complex diseases. The 
biomedical promise of human induced pluripotent stem cellgenerated 
cardiomyocytes derived from the patients own skin biopsy specimen 
(fibroblast) is enormous and may hold significant promise in cardiac 
research  involving  disease  models,  personalized  drug  development, 
and key questions about the reduced penetrance and variable expres-
sivity that is common in these cardiac channelopathies.
