The care of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 
has transformed in conjunction with major shifts in the approach to 
reperfusion therapy from primarily pharmacologic to catheter-based 
strategies.1-4  With  simultaneous  advances  in  medical  therapy,  the 
case fatality rate for patients with STEMI has continued to decline.5 
Nevertheless, optimal management of patients at high risk for or with 
established  major  complications  of  STEMI  remains  critical  to  the  
care  of  this  condition.  A  discussion  of  the  management  of  STEMI  
can follow the clinical course of the patient. Chapter 42 addresses 
primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). 
This chapter deals with treatment at the time of onset of STEMI (pre-
hospital issues, initial recognition and management in the emergency 
department,  and  reperfusion),  hospital  management  (medications, 
complications, and preparation for discharge), and early secondary 
prevention  after  STEMI.  Chapter  55  discusses  percutaneous  coro-
nary intervention (PCI) in patients with STEMI. Chapter 36 describes 
the use of internal and external automated defibrillators for primary 
prevention of sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction (MI).

PREHOSPITALMANAGEMENT

Given  the  progressive  loss  of  functioning  myocytes  with  persistent 
occlusion  of  the  infarct-related  artery  in  STEMI  (see  Chapter  51), 
initial management aims to restore blood flow to the infarct zone as 
rapidly  as  possible.  Primary  PCI  (see Chapter  55)  is  generally  the 
preferred  option,  provided  that  an  experienced  operator  and  team 
can perform it in timely fashion.1,6,7 Missed opportunities for improve-
ment  in  the  care  of  STEMI  include  failure  to  deliver  any  form  of 
reperfusion therapy in approximately 20% of patients and failure to 
minimize  delays  in  reperfusion  because  of  inefficient  systems  of 
care.5,8,9 The chain of survival for STEMI involves a highly integrated 
strategy beginning with patient education about the symptoms of MI 
(see Chapter 50) and early contact with the medical system, coor-
dination  of  destination  protocols  in  emergency  medical  service 
(EMS)  systems,  efficient  practices  in  emergency  departments  to 
shorten door-to-reperfusion time, and expeditious implementation of 
the  reperfusion  strategy  by  a  trained  team.10,11  The  American  Heart 
Association  (AHA)  launched  a  national  initiative  to  engineer 

improved health care delivery for STEMI, including implementation 
of systems that shorten total ischemic time (Tables 52-1 and 52-2) 
while emphasizing overall quality of care for STEMI.11,12

Prehospital Care
The  prehospital  care  of  patients  suspected  of  having  STEMI  bears 
directly  on  the  likelihood  of  survival.  Most  deaths  associated  with 
STEMI occur within the first hour of its onset and usually result from 
ventricular  fibrillation  (VF)  (see  Chapter  39).  Hence  immediate 
implementation  of  resuscitative  efforts  and  rapid  transportation  of 
the patient to a hospital have prime importance. Major components 
of  the  delay  from  the  onset  of  ischemic  symptoms  to  reperfusion 
include the following1: (1) the time for the patient to recognize the 
seriousness of the problem and seek medical attention; (2) prehos-
pital evaluation, treatment, and transportation; (3) the time for diag-
nostic  measures  and  initiation  of  treatment  in  the  hospital  (e.g., 
door-to-needle time for patients receiving a fibrinolytic agent and 
door-to-balloon  time  for  patients  undergoing  a  catheter-based 
reperfusion strategy); and (4) the time from initiation of treatment to 
restoration of flow.

Patient-related factors that correlate with a longer time until decid-
ing  to  seek  medical  attention  include  older  age;  female  sex;  black 
race; low socioeconomic status; low emotional or somatic awareness; 
history of angina, diabetes, or both; consulting a spouse or other rela-
tive; and consulting a physician.13,14 Health care professionals should 
heighten  the  level  of  awareness  of  patients  at  risk  for  STEMI  (e.g., 
those with hypertension, diabetes, history of angina pectoris).1 They 
should use each patient encounter as a teachable moment to review 
and reinforce with patients and their families the need to seek urgent 
medical attention for a pattern of symptoms that includes chest dis-
comfort, extreme fatigue, and dyspnea, especially if accompanied by 
diaphoresis or lightheadedness. Patients should also be instructed in 
the  proper  use  of  sublingual  nitroglycerin  and  to  call  emergency 
services  if  the  ischemic-type  discomfort  persists  for  more  than  5 
minutes.1

Emergency Medical Service Systems
EMS  systems  have  three  major  components:  emergency  medical  
dispatch,  first  response,  and  the  EMS  ambulance  response.  The

expanded  capability  to  record  a  prehospital  12-lead  electrocardio-
gram  (ECG)  represents  a  major  advance  in  EMS  systems  (Table 
52-2).15 The ability to transmit such ECGs and to activate the STEMI 
care  team  before  arrival  at  the  hospital  places  EMS  efforts  at  the 
center of the early response to STEMI.16,17 Ongoing efforts to shorten 
the time until treatment of patients with STEMI include improvement 
in  the  medical  dispatch  component  by  expanding  911  coverage, 

TABLE52-1  Criteria for a System of Care for ST-Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction

1.  The system should be registered with Mission: Lifeline.
2.  Ongoing multidisciplinary team meetings should occur, including EMS, 

non-PCI hospitals/STEMI referral centers, and PCI hospitals/STEMI 
receiving centers, to evaluate outcomes and quality improvement data. 
Operational issues should be reviewed, problems identified, and 
solutions implemented.

3.  Each STEMI system should include a process for prehospital 

identification and activation, destination protocols to STEMI receiving 
centers, and transfer for patients who arrive at STEMI referral centers 
and are primary PCI candidates, are ineligible for fibrinolytic therapy, 
and/or are in cardiogenic shock.

4.  Each system should have a recognized system coordinator, physician 

champion, and EMS medical director.

5.  Each system component (EMS, STEMI referral centers, and STEMI 

receiving centers) should meet the appropriate criteria (see 
www.americanheart.org/missionlifeline).

providing  automated  external  defibrillators  to  first  responders, 
placing automated external defibrillators in critical public locations, 
and  greater  coordination  of  the  EMS  ambulance  response.  Well-
equipped ambulances and helicopters staffed by personnel trained 
in the acute care of patients with STEMI allow definitive therapy to 
begin during transport to the hospital (Table 52-3). Radiotelemetry 
systems that allow transmission of the electrocardiographic signal to 
a medical control officer are highly desirable for facilitating the triage 
of  patients  with  STEMI  and  are  becoming  increasingly  available  in 
many communities (Fig. 52-1).

In addition to prompt defibrillation, the efficacy of prehospital care 
appears to depend on several factors, including early relief of pain 
with  its  deleterious  physiologic  sequelae,  reduction  of  excessive 

TABLE52-2  Interventions to Improve Door-to-Device Times

1.  A prehospital ECG for diagnosing STEMI is used to activate the PCI 

team while the patient is en route to the hospital.

2.  Emergency physicians activate the PCI team.
3.  A single call to a central page operator activates the PCI team.
4.  A goal is set for the PCI team to arrive at the catheterization 

laboratory within 20 minutes after being paged.

5.  Timely data feedback and analysis are provided to members of the 

STEMI care team.

FIGURE52-1  System goals and initial reperfusion treatment of patients with STEMI. Reperfusion in patients with STEMI can be accomplished by pharmacologic (fibri-
nolysis) or catheter-based (primary PCI) approaches and may involve transfer from a nonPCI-capable to a primary PCI-capable center. A, Patient transported by the EMS. 
The STEMI systems goal is to maintain a network of transportation and destination hospitals so that the total ischemic time is kept to less than 120 minutes. In addition 
to  this  overall  goal,  three  additional  time  objectives  exist.  (1)  If  the  EMS  has  fibrinolytic  capability  and  the  patient  qualifies  for  therapy,  prehospital  fibrinolysis  may  be 
considered and, if used, should be started within 30 minutes of arrival of the EMS on scene. (2) For patients transported to a nonPCI-capable hospital where a fibrinolytic 
is to be administered, the hospital doorto-needle time should be 30 minutes or less. (3) If the patient is transported to a PCI-capable hospital, the time from first medical 
contact (FMC) to deployment of the first PCI device (FMC-to-device time) should be 90 minutes or less. Patient self-transportation is discouraged. If the patient arrives at 
a nonPCI-capable hospital and a fibrinolytic is to be administered, the door-to-needle time should be 30 minutes or less. If the patient arrives at a PCI-capable hospital, 
the  door-to-balloon  time  should  be  90  minutes  or  less.  The  treatment  options  and  time  recommendations  after  arrival  at  the  hospital  are  the  same.  Consideration  of 
emergency interhospital transfer of the patient to a PCI-capable hospital for mechanical revascularization is also appropriate if use of a fibrinolysis is contraindicated or PCI 
can be initiated promptly (anticipated FMC-to-device time 120 minutes) or if fibrinolysis is unsuccessful (i.e., rescue PCI). Secondary nonemergency interhospital transfer 
can be considered for recurrent ischemia or routine invasive evaluation 3 to 24 hours after fibrinolysis. B, Reperfusion strategies for patients with STEMI, regardless of 
whether they go to a PCI-capable or to a nonPCI-capable hospital. The optimal strategy depends on the timing of the onset of symptoms, the patients eligibility for 
fibrinolysis,  and  the  options  for  timely  transfer  to  a  PCI-capable  hospital.  The  denoted  class  I  and  class  II  recommendations  are  from  the  ACCF/AHA  guidelines  for  the 
management of STEMI. For patients who receive fibrinolysis, noninvasive risk stratification is recommended to guide decisions regarding delayed coronary revascularization.

activity of the autonomic nervous system, and treatment of arrhyth-
mias  such  as  ventricular  tachycardia  (VT)but  these  efforts  must 
not delay rapid transfer to the hospital (Fig. 52-1).

Prehospital Fibrinolysis
Multiple  observational  studies  and  several  randomized  trials  have 
evaluated the potential benefits of prehospital versus in-hospital fibri-
nolysis.1,17 Although none of the individual trials showed a significant 
reduction in mortality with prehospital-initiated fibrinolytic therapy, 
earlier treatment generally provides greater benefit: a meta-analysis 
of all the available trials demonstrated a 17% reduction in mortality.1 
The CAPTIM (Comparison of primary Angioplasty and Pre-hospital 
fibrinolysis In acute Myocardial infarction) trial, for example, reported 
a  trend  toward  a  lower  mortality  rate  in  patients  with  STEMI  who 
received prehospital fibrinolysis than in those who received primary 
PCI,  especially  if  they  were  treated  within  2  hours  of  the  onset  of 

symptoms.1 Prehospital fibrinolysis is reasonable in settings in which 
substantial  time  can  be  saved  by  prehospital  treatment  because  of 
long transportation times (i.e., 60 to 90 minutes or longer), physicians 
are present in the ambulance, or there is a well-organized EMS system 
with full-time paramedics who can obtain and transmit 12-lead elec-
trocardiographic  recordings  from  the  field  to  an  online  medical 
command able to authorize prehospital fibrinolysis (Fig. 52-1).18

not discharging patients inappropriately while avoiding unnecessary 
admissions.  A  history  of  ischemic-type  discomfort  and  the  initial 
12-lead ECG are the primary tools for screening patients with possible 
acute  coronary  syndromes  (ACSs)  for  STEMI  (see  Chapter  50).19 
Because the 12-lead ECG is at the center of the decision pathway for 
initiation of reperfusion therapy, it should be obtained promptly (10 
minutes after hospital arrival) in patients with ischemic discomfort.1 
More  extensive  use  of  prehospital  12-lead  ECGs  has  also  facilitated 
early triage of patients with STEMI.15 Because lethal arrhythmias can 
occur  suddenly  in  patients  with  STEMI,  all  patients  should  have 
bedside monitoring of the ECG and intravenous access.

The presence of ST-segment elevation on the ECG in a patient with 
ischemic  discomfort  highly  suggests  thrombotic  occlusion  of  an  
epicardial  coronary  artery,  and  it  should  trigger  a  well-rehearsed 
sequence of rapid assessment of the patient for initiation of a reperfu-
sion strategy.1 If the initial ECG reveals ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV 
or greater in at least two contiguous leads or a new or presumably 
new left bundle branch block, the patient should be evaluated imme-
diately for a reperfusion strategy. Critical factors that weigh into selec-
tion of a reperfusion strategy include the time elapsed since the onset 
of  symptoms,  the  risk  associated  with  STEMI,  the  risk  related  to 
administering a fibrinolytic, and the time required to initiate an inva-
sive  strategy  (Fig.  52-1).  In  nonPCI-capable  hospitals,  the  initial 
assessment  should  include  evaluation  of  the  contraindications  to 
administration of a fibrinolytic (Table 52-4). Patients with an initial 
ECG that reveals new or presumably new ST-segment depression and/
or T wave inversion without ST-segment elevation are not considered 
candidates  for  immediate  reperfusion  therapy  unless  a  posterior 
injury current is suspected (see Chapter 53).

Given the importance of time to reperfusion,7 emphasis has shifted 
to overall medical system goals, starting at the point of first medical

contact with the patient.1,20 Benchmarks for medical systems to use 
when assessing the quality of their performance are a door-to-needle 
time of 30 minutes or less for initiation of fibrinolytic therapy and a 
door-to-device time of 90 minutes or less for percutaneous coronary 
perfusion (Fig. 52-1).1,4

In patients with a clinical history suggestive of STEMI (see Chapter 
50) and an initial nondiagnostic ECG (i.e., no ST-segment deviation 
or T wave inversion), serial tracings should be obtained during evalu-
ation in the emergency department. Emergency department staff can 
seek  the  sudden  development  of  ST-segment  elevation  by  periodic 
visual  inspection  of  the  bedside  electrocardiographic  monitor,  by 
continuous  ST-segment  recording,  or  by  auditory  alarms  when  the 
ST-segment  deviation  exceeds  programmed  limits.  Decision  aids 
such as computer-based diagnostic algorithms, identification of high-
risk  clinical  indicators,  rapid  determination  of  cardiac  biomarkers, 
echocardiographic  evaluation  for  regional  wall  motion  abnormali-
ties, and myocardial perfusion imaging have greatest clinical useful-
ness when the findings on the ECG are not diagnostic.

General Treatment Measures
Aspirin (See also Chapter 82)
Aspirin  is  effective  across  the  entire  ACS  spectrum  and  is  part  of  
the  initial  management  strategy  for  patients  with  suspected  STEMI. 
Because  low  doses  take  several  days  to  achieve  a  full  antiplatelet 
effect, 162 to 325 mg should be administered at the first opportunity 
after  initial  medical  contact.1  To  achieve  therapeutic  blood  levels 
rapidly, the patient should chew the tablet to promote buccal absorp-
tion rather than absorption through the gastric mucosa.21

Control of Cardiac Pain
Initial management of patients with STEMI should target relief of pain 
and its associated heightened sympathetic activity. Control of cardiac 
pain  is  typically  achieved  with  a  combination  of  analgesics  (e.g., 
morphine)  and  interventions  to  favorably  improve  the  balance  of 
myocardial oxygen supply and demand, including oxygen, nitrates, 
and  in  appropriately  selected  patients,  beta-adrenergic  receptor
blocking agents (beta blockers).1

ANALGESICS.  Although  a  wide  variety  of  analgesic  agents
including meperidine, pentazocine, and morphinehave been used 
to treat the pain associated with STEMI, morphine remains the drug 
of choice, except in patients with well-documented morphine hyper-
sensitivity. Doses of 4 to 8 mg administered intravenously and doses 
of 2 to 8 mg repeated at intervals of 5 to 15 minutes have been recom-
mended1 until the pain is relieved or side effects emergehypotension, 
depression of respiration, or severe vomitingthat preclude further 
administration  of  the  drug.  Appropriate  dosing  of  morphine  sulfate 
will vary, however, depending on the patients age, body size, blood 
pressure, and heart rate.

Reduction  of  anxiety  with  successful  analgesia  diminishes  the 
patients  restlessness  and  the  activity  of  the  autonomic  nervous 
system,  with  a  consequent  reduction  in  the  hearts  metabolic 
demands. Morphine has beneficial effects in patients with pulmonary 
edema  caused  by  peripheral  arterial  and  venous  dilation  (particu-
larly  in  those  with  excessive  sympathoadrenal  activity);  it  reduces  
the  work  of  breathing  and  slows  the  heart  rate  secondary  to  com-
bined  withdrawal  of  sympathetic  tone  and  augmentation  of  vagal 
tone. Observational studies have identified an association between 
the  administration  of  morphine  and  adverse  outcomes  in  patients 
with ACSs; however, it is challenging to disentangle this observation 
from confounding by indication.

Maintaining the patient in a supine position and elevating the lower 
extremities if blood pressure falls can minimize hypotension follow-
ing the administration of nitroglycerin and morphine. Such position-
ing is undesirable in patients with pulmonary edema, but morphine 
rarely produces hypotension in these circumstances. Administration 
of  atropine  intravenously  may  be  helpful  in  treating  the  excessive 
vagomimetic effects of morphine.

NITRATES.  By  virtue  of  their  ability  to  enhance  coronary  blood 
flow by coronary vasodilation and to decrease ventricular preload by 
increasing venous capacitance, sublingual nitrates are indicated for

most  patients  with  an  ACS.  At  present,  the  only  groups  of  patients 
with STEMI in whom sublingual nitroglycerin should not be given are 
those  with  suspected  right  ventricular  infarction22  or  marked  hypo-
tension  (e.g.,  systolic  pressure  <90 mm Hg),  especially  if  accompa-
nied by bradycardia.

Once  hypotension  is  excluded,  a  sublingual  nitroglycerin  tablet 
should be administered and the patient observed for improvement in 
symptoms or change in hemodynamics. If an initial dose is well toler-
ated and appears to be beneficial, further nitrates should be adminis-
tered  while  monitoring  vital  signs.  Even  small  doses  can  produce 
sudden  hypotension  and  bradycardia,  a  reaction  that  can  usually  be 
reversed  with  intravenous  atropine.  Long-acting  oral  nitrate  prepara-
tions should be avoided in the early course of STEMI because of the 
frequently changing hemodynamic status of the patient. In patients with 
a prolonged period of waxing and waning chest pain, intravenous nitro-
glycerin may help control the symptoms and correct the ischemia, but 
frequent monitoring of blood pressure is required. Initiation of a reper-
fusion  strategy  in  patients  with  STEMI  should  not  be  delayed  while 
assessing the patients response to sublingual or intravenous nitrates.

BETA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING AGENTS.  These drugs aid in the 
relief  of  ischemic  pain,  reduce  the  need  for  analgesics  in  many 
patients,  and  reduce  infarct  size  and  life-threatening  arrhythmias. 
Avoiding early intravenous blockade in patients with Killip class II or 
greater  is  important,  however,  because  of  the  risk  of  precipitating 
cardiogenic  shock.1  Routine  use  of  intravenous  beta  blockers  is  no 
longer  recommended  in  patients  with  STEMI,  but  administration  
of  a  beta  blocker  intravenously  at  the  initial  evaluation  of  patients 
with  STEMI  who  are  hypertensive  and  have  ongoing  ischemia  is 
reasonable.1

A practical protocol for use of a beta blocker in this situation is as 
follows. (1) Exclude patients with heart failure, hypotension (systolic 
blood pressure <90 mm Hg), bradycardia (heart rate <60 beats/min), 
or significant atrioventricular (AV) block. (2) Administer metoprolol in 
three  5-mg  intravenous  boluses.  (3)  Observe  the  patient  for  2  to  5 
minutes after each bolus, and if the heart rate falls below 60 beats/min 
or systolic blood pressure falls below 100 mm Hg, do not administer 
any  further  drug.  (4)  If  hemodynamic  stability  continues  15  minutes 
after  the  last  intravenous  dose,  begin  oral  metoprolol  tartrate,  25  to 
50 mg  every  6  hours  for  2  to  3  days  as  tolerated,  and  then  switch  to 
100 mg twice daily.1 Lower doses may be used in patients who have a 
partial decline in blood pressure with the initial dosing or who appear 
to be at higher risk (e.g., larger infarction) for the development of heart 
failure  because  of  poor  left  ventricular  performance.  Infusion  of  an 
extremely short-acting beta blocker, such as esmolol, 50 to 250 mg/kg/
min,  may  be  useful  in  patients  with  relative  contraindications  to  the 
administration of a beta blocker and in whom slowing of the heart rate 
is considered highly desirable.23

OXYGEN.  Hypoxemia can occur in patients with STEMI and gen-
erally  results  from  ventilation-perfusion  abnormalities  that  are 
sequelae of left ventricular failure; concomitant intrinsic pulmonary 
disease  may  be  an  additional  cause  of  hypoxemia.  Treating  all 
patients hospitalized for STEMI with oxygen for at least 24 to 48 hours 
is  common  practice  based  on  the  empiric  assumption  of  hypoxia  
and evidence that increased oxygen in the inspired air may protect 
ischemic  myocardium.  However,  augmentation  of  the  fraction  of 
oxygen  in  the  inspired  air  does  not  elevate  oxygen  delivery  signifi-
cantly  in  patients  who  are  not  hypoxemic.  Furthermore,  it  may 
increase  systemic  vascular  resistance  and  arterial  pressure  and 
thereby lower cardiac output slightly.

In view of these considerations, arterial oxygen saturation can be 
estimated by pulse oximetry, and oxygen therapy can be omitted if 
the oximetric findings are normal. On the other hand, patients with 
STEMI  and  arterial  hypoxemia  should  receive  oxygen.1  In  patients 
with severe pulmonary edema, endotracheal intubation and mechan-
ical  ventilation  may  be  necessary  to  correct  the  hypoxemia  and 
reduce the work of breathing.

Limitation of Infarct Size
Infarct size is an important determinant of prognosis in patients with 
STEMI.  Patients  who  succumb  from  cardiogenic  shock  generally 

1099

exhibit either a single massive infarct or a small to moderate infarct 
superimposed  on  multiple  previous  infarctions.24,25  Survivors  with 
large infarcts frequently exhibit late impairment of ventricular func-
tion, and their long-term mortality rate is higher than that of survivors 
with  small  infarcts,  in  whom  cardiac  decompensation  tends  not  to 
develop.26  In  view  of  the  prognostic  importance  of  infarct  size,  the 
possibility of modifying infarct size has attracted much experimental 
and clinical attention (see Chapter 51, Fig. 51-11).7,27 Efforts to limit 
infarct  size  have  been  divided  among  several  different  (sometimes 
overlapping) approaches: (1) early reperfusion, (2) reduction of myo-
cardial  energy  demands,  (3)  manipulation  of  energy  production 
sources in the myocardium, and (4) prevention of reperfusion injury.

Dynamic Nature of Infarction
STEMI is a dynamic process that does not occur instantaneously but 
rather evolves over a period of hours. The fate of jeopardized, ische-
mic  tissue  can  be  favorably  affected  by  interventions  that  restore 
myocardial  perfusion,  reduce  microvascular  damage  in  the  infarct 
zone, decrease myocardial oxygen requirements, inhibit accumula-
tion or facilitate washout of noxious metabolites, augment the avail-
ability of substrate for anaerobic metabolism, or blunt the effects of 
mediators  of  injury  that  compromise  the  structure  and  function  of 
intracellular organelles and constituents of cell membranes. Strong 
evidence in experimental animals and suggestive evidence in patients 
indicate that ischemic preconditioning, a form of endogenous protec-
tion against STEMI, before sustained coronary occlusion decreases 
infarct size and is associated with a more favorable outcome along 
with decreased risk for extension of infarction and recurrent ische-
mic events. Brief episodes of ischemia in one coronary vascular bed 
may precondition myocardium in a remote zone and thereby attenu-
ate the size of infarction in the latter when sustained coronary occlu-
sion occurs.28

Perfusion of myocardium in the infarct zone appears to be reduced 
maximally immediately following coronary occlusion. Spontaneous 
recanalization of an occluded infarct-related artery occurs in up to a 
third of patients beginning at 12 to 24 hours. This delayed spontane-
ous  reperfusion  may  enhance  left  ventricular  function  because  it 
improves healing of infarcted tissue, prevents ventricular remodeling, 
and  reperfuses  hibernating  myocardium.  Yet,  strategies  involving 
pharmacologically  induced  and  catheter-based  reperfusion  of  the 
infarct vessel can maximize the amount of salvaged myocardium by 
accelerating the process of reperfusion and also implementing it in 
patients who would otherwise have an occluded infarct-related artery 
(Fig. 52-1) (see Chapter 55). An overarching concept that applies to 
all methods of reperfusion is the critical importance of time. Reduc-
tion  of  mortality  in  patients  with  STEMI  is  greatest  the  earlier  the 
infarct artery is reperfused (Fig. 52-2).1

Additional  factors  that  may  limit  infarct  size  during  reperfusion 
include relief of coronary spasm, prevention of damage to the micro-
vasculature,  improved  systemic  hemodynamics  (augmentation  of 
coronary  perfusion  pressure  and  reduced  left  ventricular  end-
diastolic  pressure),  and  collateral  circulation.  Prompt  implementa-
tion  of  measures  designed  to  protect  ischemic  myocardium  and 
support  myocardial  perfusion  may  provide  sufficient  time  for  the 
development  of  compensatory  mechanisms  that  limit  the  ultimate 
extent  of  infarction  (see  Chapter  51).  Interventions  designed  to 
protect  ischemic  myocardium  during  the  initial  event  may  also 
reduce the extension of infarction or early reinfarction.

Routine Measures for Limitation of Infarct Size
Although  timely  reperfusion  of  ischemic  myocardium  is  the  most 
important technique for limiting infarct size, several routine measures 
to accomplish this goal apply to all patients with STEMI, regardless 
of whether they receive reperfusion therapy.1 The treatment strategies 
discussed in this section can be initiated at first medical contact and 
be continued throughout the hospital phase of care.

Myocardial  oxygen  consumption  should  be  minimized  by  main-
taining  the  patient  at  rest  both  physically  and  emotionally  and  by 
using mild sedation and a quiet atmospherein addition to the inter-
ventions  already  discussed.  Administration  of  adrenergic  agonists 

1100

should be avoided whenever possible. All forms of tachyarrhythmia 
require prompt treatment because they increase myocardial oxygen 
needs.  Heart  failure  should  also  be  treated  swiftly  to  minimize 
increases  in  adrenergic  tone  and  hypoxemia  (see  the  section  Left 
Ventricular Failure).

If ongoing ischemia occurs, severe anemia should be corrected by 
the cautious administration of packed red blood cells, accompanied 
by  a  diuretic  if  there  is  any  evidence  of  left  ventricular  failure.  
Associated  conditions,  particularly  infections  and  accompanying 
tachycardia,  fever,  and  elevated  myocardial  oxygen  needs,  require 
management.

REPERFUSION THERAPY (hr)

Critical time-dependent period
Goal: Myocardial salvage
Time-independent period
Goal: Open infarct-related artery

FIGURE52-2  The reduction in mortality as a benefit of reperfusion therapy is 
greatest in the first 2 to 3 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute MI, most 
likely a consequence of myocardial salvage. The exact duration of this critical early 
period may be modified by several factors, including the presence of functioning 
collateral coronary arteries, ischemic preconditioning, myocardial oxygen demands, 
and the duration of sustained ischemia. After this early period the magnitude of 
the mortality benefit is much reduced, and as the mortality reduction curve flattens, 
time to reperfusion therapy is less critical. The magnitude of the benefit depends 
on how far up the curve that the patient can be shifted. The benefit of a shift from 
point A or B to point C would be substantial, but the benefit of a shift from point 
A to point B would be small. This schematic illustrates how a treatment strategy 
that delays therapy during the early critical period, such as transfer of a patient for 
PCI with a long transportation time, could be harmful (shift from point D to point 
C  or  point  B).  (Modified  from  Gersh  BJ,  Stone  GW,  White  HD,  Homes  DR  Jr:

REPERFUSIONTHERAPY

General Concepts
Although  late  spontaneous  reperfusion  occurs  in  some  patients, 
thrombotic  occlusion  persists  in  most  patients  with  STEMI.  Timely 
reperfusion of jeopardized myocardium is the most effective way of 
restoring  the  balance  between  myocardial  oxygen  supply  and 
demand.29  The  dependence  of  myocardial  salvage  on  the  time 
elapsed until treatment pertains to patients treated with either fibri-
nolysis  or  PCI1,30,31  (Fig.  52-3;  also  see  Fig.  52-2).  The  efficacy  of 
fibrinolytic agents decreases as coronary thrombi mature over time 
(Fig. 52-3). Analyses adjusted for baseline risk, however, demonstrate 
a statistically significant increase in in-hospital and long-term mortal-
ity  with  progressive  delays  between  the  onset  of  symptoms  and 
PCI.30,32 Each 30-minute delay from symptom onset to PCI increases 
the relative risk (RR) for 1-year mortality by 8%.1

In some patients, particularly those with cardiogenic shock, tissue 
damage  occurs  in  a  stuttering  manner  rather  than  abruptly.  This 
concept of the infarction process, as well as the observation that the 
incidence of complications of STEMI in both the early and late postin-
farction  periods  depends  on  infarct  size,  underscores  the  need  for 
careful  history  taking  to  ascertain  whether  the  patient  appears  to 
have had repetitive cycles of spontaneous reperfusion and reocclu-
sion. Determining the precise time of onset of the infarction process 
in these patients, however, can be difficult and sometimes mislead-
ing. In such patients with waxing and waning ischemic discomfort, 
a rigid time interval from the first episode of pain should not be used 
when  determining  whether  a  patient  is  outside  the  window  for 
benefit from acute reperfusion therapy.

PRIMARY PCI

Pathophysiology of Myocardial Reperfusion
Prevention of cell death by restoration of blood flow depends on the 
severity and duration of the preexisting ischemia. Substantial experi-
mental and clinical evidence indicates that the earlier blood flow is 
restored, the more favorably influenced are recovery of left ventricu-
lar  systolic  function,  improvement  in  diastolic  function,  and  reduc-
tion in overall mortality.1 Collateral coronary vessels also appear to 
influence  left  ventricular  function  fol-
lowing  reperfusion.33  They  provide  suf-
ficient  perfusion  of  myocardium  to  
slow  cell  death  and  probably  have 
greater importance in patients undergo-
ing  reperfusion  later  than  1  to  2  hours 
after coronary occlusion. Even after suc-
cessful  reperfusion  and  despite  the 
absence  of 
irreversible  myocardial 
damage, a period of postischemic con-
tractile  dysfunction  can  occura  phe-
nomenon  referred  to  as  myocardial 
stunning.34

The  process  of  reperfusion,  although

restoration  of  coronary  blood  flow;  (2)  vascular  reperfusion  injury, 
which is progressive damage to the microvasculature such that there 
is an expanding area of no-reflow and loss of coronary vasodilatory 
reserve;  (3)  stunned  myocardium,  in  which  salvaged  myocytes 
display a prolonged period of contractile dysfunction following res-
toration  of  blood  flow  because  of  abnormalities  in  intracellular 
metabolism leading to reduced energy production; and (4) reperfu-
sion arrhythmias, which refers to bursts of VT (and on occasion, VF) 
that  occur  within  seconds  of  reperfusion.37  Evidence  suggests  that 
vascular  reperfusion  injury,  stunning,  and  reperfusion  arrhythmias 
can all occur in patients with STEMI. The concept of lethal reperfu-
sion injury to potentially salvageable myocardium remains controver-
sial, both in animals and in humans.36,38,39

Microvasculature damage in the reperfused myocardium can lead 
to  a  hemorrhagic  infarct  (see  Chapter  51).  Fibrinolytic  therapy 
appears more likely than catheter-based reperfusion to produce hem-
orrhagic infarction. Although concern has been raised that this hem-
orrhage may lead to extension of the infarct, such does not appear 
to be the case. Histologic study of patients not surviving despite suc-
cessful reperfusion has revealed hemorrhagic infarcts, but this hem-
orrhage does not usually extend beyond the area of necrosis.

Protection Against Reperfusion Injury
A variety of adjunctive therapies have been proposed to mitigate the 
injury that occurs after reperfusion, including preservation of micro-
vascular  integrity  by  using  antiplatelet  agents  and  antithrombins  to 
minimize embolization of atheroembolic debris, prevention of inflam-
matory  damage,  and  metabolic  support  of  the  ischemic  myocar-
dium.36,39,40  The  effectiveness  of  interventions  directed  against 
reperfusion injury appears to decline rapidly the later that they are 
administered after reperfusion. In animal models, no beneficial effect 
is detectable after 45 to 60 minutes of reperfusion has elapsed. Intrigu-
ingly,  the  phenomenon  of  induction  of  transient  ischemia  in  other 
vascular beds has also been associated with a reduction in reperfu-
sion injury, a concept called remote conditioning.28

An alternative experimental approach to protection against reper-
fusion  injury  is  called  postconditioning,  which  involves  introducing 
brief, repetitive episodes of ischemia alternating with reperfusion.41 
This appears to activate the cellular protective mechanisms centering 
around  prosurvival  kinases.42  Many  of  these  protective  kinases  are 
also  activated  during  ischemic  preconditioning.  Clinical  studies  in 
patients  with  STEMI  undergoing  PCI  have  provided  evidence  that 
postconditioning  protects  the  human  heart  and  is  associated  with 
reduced infarct size and improvement in myocardial perfusion.43

Reperfusion Arrhythmias
Transient  sinus  bradycardia  occurs  in  many  patients  with  inferior 
infarcts at the time of acute reperfusion, often accompanied by some 
degree of hypotension. This combination of hypotension and brady-
cardia with a sudden increase in coronary flow may involve activation 
of  the  Bezold-Jarisch  reflex.44  Premature  ventricular  contractions, 
accelerated idioventricular rhythm, and nonsustained VT also com-
monly  follow  successful  reperfusion.  Although  some  investigators 
have  postulated  that  early  afterdepolarizations  participate  in  the 
genesis  of  reperfusion-related  ventricular  arrhythmias,  they  are 
present during both ischemia and reperfusion and therefore not likely 
to be involved in the development of reperfusion-associated VT or VF.
When present, rhythm disturbances may actually indicate success-
ful  restoration  of  coronary  flow,  but  their  specificity  for  successful 
reperfusion  is  limited.  In  general,  clinical  features  are  inaccurate 
markers of reperfusion, with no single clinical finding or constellation 
of  findings  being  reliably  predictive  of  angiographically  demon-
strated coronary artery patency.1

Although reperfusion arrhythmias may show a temporal clustering 
at  the  time  of  restoration  of  coronary  blood  flow  in  patients  
after successful fibrinolysis, this brief electrical storm is generally 
innocuous, and therefore no prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy is 
necessary  and  specific  treatment  is  not  indicated,  except  in  rare 
cases  of  symptomatic  or  hemodynamically  significant  reperfusion 
arrhythmias.1

1101

Late Establishment of Patency of the Infarct Vessel
The improved survival and ventricular function after successful reper-
fusion may not result entirely from limitation of infarct size.45 Poorly 
contracting or noncontracting myocardium in a zone that is supplied 
by a stenosed infarct-related artery with slow anterograde perfusion 
may still contain viable myocytes. The function of so-called hibernat-
ing  myocardium  can  be  improved  by  PCI  to  augment  flow  in  the 
infarct-related artery.46,47

Summary of the Effects of Myocardial Reperfusion
Disruption of plaque in the culprit vessel and subsequent thrombus 
formation  produces  complete  occlusion  of  the  infarct-related  coro-
nary artery. STEMI occurs with the ensuing development of left ven-
tricular dilation and ultimately cell death through a combination of 
pump failure and electrical instability (see Chapter 51). Early reper-
fusion  shortens  the  duration  of  coronary  occlusion,  minimizes  the 
degree  of  ultimate  left  ventricular  dysfunction  and  dilation,  and 
reduces  the  probability  that  pump  failure  or  malignant  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias will develop in patients with STEMI. Late reperfu-
sion of stenosed infarct arteries may also restore contractile function 
in hibernating myocardium.

Fibrinolysis
Fibrinolysis  recanalizes  the  thrombotic  occlusion  associated  with 
STEMI,  and  restoration  of  coronary  flow  reduces  infarct  size  and 
improves myocardial function and survival over both the short and 
long term.48 Patients treated within the first 1 to 2 hours after the onset 
of  symptoms  seem  to  have  the  greatest  potential  for  long-term 
improvement in survival with fibrinolysis.1

Assessment of Reperfusion
TIMI Flow Grade.  To provide a level of standardization both for 
clinical communication and for studies comparing various reperfusion 
regimens,  most  clinicians  and  investigators  describe  the  flow  in  the 
infarct vessel according to the TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarc-
tion) trial grading system (Fig. 52-4).49 Importantly, an angiographic 
snapshot in time does not reflect the fluctuating status of flow in the 
infarct  vessel,  which  may  undergo  repeated  cycles  of  patency  and 
reocclusion before or during fibrinolysis.

When  assessed  60  to  90  minutes  after  the  start  of  fibrinolytic 
therapy,2,48 the finding of TIMI grade 3 flow is far superior to grade 2 
in terms of reduction of infarct size and both short-term and long-term 
mortality  benefit.  Therefore  TIMI  grade  3  flow  should  be  the  goal 
when assessing flow in the epicardial infarct artery (Fig. 52-4).

The TIMI Frame Count.  In an effort to provide a more quantita-
tive statement of the briskness of coronary blood flow in the infarct 
artery and to account for differences in the size and length of vessels 
(e.g.,  left  anterior  descending  versus  right  coronary  artery)  and 
interobserver  variability,  Gibson  and  coworkers  developed  the  TIMI 
frame counta simple count of the number of angiographic frames 
elapsed until the contrast material arrives in the distal bed of the vessel 
of  interest.  This  objective  and  quantitative  index  of  coronary  blood 
flow independently predicts in-hospital mortality from STEMI and also 
discriminates patients with TIMI grade 3 flow into low-risk and high-
risk  groups.  The  TIMI  frame  count  can  also  be  used  to  quantitate 
coronary blood flow (mL/sec), as calculated by

(based on Doppler velocity wire data showing that normal flow equals 
1.7 cm3/sec, which is proportional to 21 frames). The calculated coro-
nary perfusion is related to mortality in patients treated with fibrino-
lytics  or  primary  PCI  and  serves  to  assess  various  modalities  for 
reperfusion in patients with STEMI.

Myocardial Perfusion.  Despite the priority placed on normaliza-
tion  of  flow  in  the  epicardial  infarct-related  artery,  reperfusion  in 
patients with STEMI is ultimately intended to improve actual myocar-
dial  perfusion  in  the  infarct  zone.  Myocardial  perfusion  cannot  be 
improved  adequately  without  restoration  of  flow  in  the  occluded 
infarct-related  artery,  but  even  patients  with  TIMI  grade  3  flow   
may  not  achieve  adequate  myocardial  perfusion,  especially  if  the   
delay  between  the  onset  of  symptoms  and  restoration  of  epicardial 
flow is long.50,51 The term myocardial no-reflow has been used to 
describe a state with reduced myocardial perfusion after opening of

FIGURE52-5  Points of possible failure of reperfusion therapy. Complete reper-
fusion requires successful restoration of normal flow in both the epicardial coronary 
artery  and  the  distal  coronary  microvasculature,  termed  myocardial  tissuelevel 
reperfusion. Failure of epicardial reperfusion can result from failure to induce a lytic 
state or from persistent mechanical obstruction at the site of occlusion. Failure of 
microvascular  reperfusion  is  caused  by  a  combination  of  platelet  microthrombi 
followed by endothelial swelling and myocardial edema (no reflow). Reperfusion 
may fail because of persistent occlusion of the epicardial infarct-related artery (TIMI 
grades 0 and 1), patency of an epicardial artery in the presence of impaired (TIMI 
grade 2) flow, or microvascular occlusion in the presence of angiographically normal 
(TIMI grade 3) flow. Successful reperfusion requires a patent artery with an intact 
microvascular  network.  (Modified  from  Davies  CH,  Ormerod  OJ:  Failed  coronary 
thrombolysis. Lancet 351:1191, 1998.)

Invasive  Assessment.  Doppler  flow  wire  studies  can  also  define 
abnormalities  in  myocardial  perfusion.  In  addition,  an  angiographic 
method  for  assessing  myocardial  perfusion  has  been  developed  by 
Gibson  and  colleagues:  the  TIMI  myocardial  perfusion  (TMP)  grade 
(Fig.  52-6).50,59  Abnormalities  associated  with  increasing  myocardial 
perfusion, as assessed by the TIMI grade, correlate with unfavorable 
ventricular remodeling and risk for mortality even after adjusting for 
the presence of TIMI grade 3 flow or a normal TIMI frame count.50,60

Effect of Fibrinolytic Therapy on Mortality
Early  intravenous  fibrinolysis  improves  survival  in  patients  with 
STEMI.1  The  benefit  of  fibrinolytic  therapy  appears  to  be  greatest 
when  agents  are  administered  as  early  as  possible,  with  the  most 
dramatic  results  occurring  when  the  drug  is  given  less  than  1  to  2 
hours after symptoms begin.2

The Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists (FTT) Collaborative Group per-
formed  a  comprehensive  overview  of  nine  trials  of  thrombolytic 
therapy,  each  of  which  enrolled  more  than  1000  patients.  Absolute 
mortality  rates  for  the  control  and  fibrinolytic  groups  stratified  by 
initial  features  are  shown  in  Figure  52-7.  The  overall  results  indi-
cated  an  18%  reduction  in  short-term  mortality,  but  as  much  as  a 
25%  reduction  in  mortality  in  the  subset  of  45,000  patients  with 
ST-segment  elevation  or  bundle  branch  block.  Two  trials,  LATE 
(Late  Assessment  of  Thrombolytic  Efficacy)  and  EMERAS  (Estudio 
Multicntrico  Estreptoquinasa  Repblicas  de  Amrica  del  Sur), 
when viewed together, provide evidence that a reduction in mortal-
ity  may  still  be  observed  in  patients  treated  with  thrombolytic 
agents  between  6  and  12  hours  after  the  onset  of  ischemic  symp-
toms. Data from the LATE and EMERAS trials and the FTT overview 
form  the  basis  for  extending  the  window  of  treatment  with  fibrino-
lytics  up  to  12  hours  after  the  onset  of  symptoms.  As  cited  in  the 
American  College  of  Cardiology  Foundation  (ACCF)/AHA  guide-
lines  for  the  management  of  ST-elevation  MI  (referred  to  hereafter 
as the guidelines), Boersma and colleagues pooled the trials in the 
FTT  overview,  two  smaller  studies  with  data  on  time  until  random-
ization, and 11 additional trials.1 Patients were divided into six time 
categories from the onset of symptoms to randomization. A nonlin-
ear relationship of treatment benefit to time was observed, with the 
greatest benefit occurring in the first 1 to 2 hours after the onset of 
symptoms.1

FIGURE52-4  Correlation of TIMI flow grade and mortality. A pooled analysis 
of data from 5498 patients in several angiographic trials of reperfusion for STEMI 
showed a gradient of mortality when the angiographic findings were stratified by 
TIMI flow grade. Patients with TIMI 0 or TIMI 1 flow had the highest rate of mortal-
ity, TIMI 2 flow associated with an intermediate rate of mortality, and the lowest 
rate of mortality was observed in patients with TIMI 3 flow. (Courtesy Dr. Michael

an epicardial infarct-related artery.52 The two major impediments to 
normalization  of  myocardial  perfusion  are  microvascular  damage   
(Fig. 52-5)50 and reperfusion injury. Obstruction of the distal micro-
vasculature in the downstream bed of the infarct-related artery results 
from platelet microemboli and thrombi. Fibrinolysis may actually exac-
erbate microembolization of platelet aggregates because of the expo-
sure  of  clot-bound  thrombin,  an  extremely  potent  platelet  agonist. 
Spasm  can  also  occur  in  the  microvasculature  as  a  consequence  of 
release  of  substances  from  activated  platelets.  Reperfusion  injury 
results  in  cellular  edema,  formation  of  reactive  oxygen  species,  and 
calcium overload. In addition, cytokine activation leads to the accu-
mulation of neutrophils and inflammatory mediators that contribute 
to tissue injury.52

Several techniques can be used to evaluate the adequacy of myo-

cardial perfusion.

Electrocardiography.  Electrocardiographic  ST-segment  resolu-
tion strongly predicts outcome in patients with STEMI but is a better 
predictor of an occluded artery than a patent infarct-related artery.53,54 
The  persistence  of  ST-segment  elevation  after  angiographically  suc-
cessful primary PCI identifies patients with a higher risk for left ven-
tricular dysfunction and mortality, presumably because of microvascular 
damage in the infarct zone. Thus the 12-lead ECG is a marker of the 
biologic  integrity  of  myocytes  in  the  infarct  zone  and  can  reflect 
inadequate myocardial perfusion even in the presence of TIMI grade 
3 flow.55 The extent of ST-segment resolution provides powerful prog-
nostic information early in the management of patients with STEMI.56 
Given  the  dynamic  nature  of  coronary  occlusion,  continuous 
ST-segment  monitoring  may  prove  more  informative  than  static 
12-lead electrocardiographic recordings.

Noninvasive  Imaging.  Defects  in  perfusion  patterns  seen  with 
myocardial  contrast-enhanced  echocardiography  correlate  with 
regional wall motion abnormalities and lack of myocardial viability on 
dobutamine  stress  echocardiography  (see  Chapter  14).57  Contrast-
enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also identify 
regions  of  microvascular  obstruction,  which  are  associated  with  an 
adverse long-term prognosis (see Chapter 17).58

Comparison of Fibrinolytic 
Agents (See Chapter 82)
Comparative features of the approved 
fibrinolytic  agents  for  intravenous 
therapy are presented in Table 52-5. 
All  fibrinolytic  agents  exert  their 
effect  by  converting  the  proenzyme 
plasminogen  to  the  active  enzyme 
plasmin. The so-called fibrin-specific 
fibrinolytics  are  those  that  are  rela-
tively  inactive  in  the  absence  of 
fibrin  but  in  its  presence  substan-
tially 
their  activity  on 
plasminogen.

increase 

The  tissue  plasminogen  activator 
(t-PA) molecule contains five domains 
(Fig. 52-9).64 In the absence of fibrin, 
t-PA is a weak plasminogen activator; 
fibrin  provides  a  scaffold  on  which 
t-PA  and  plasminogen  are  held  in  
such  a  way  that  the  catalytic  effi-
ciency  of  plasminogen  activating  t- 
PA  is  increased  many-fold.  A  dose 
regimen  of  t-PA  administered  over  a 
90-minute  period  produces  more 
rapid thrombolysis than does a 3-hour 
fixed-rate infusion. Therefore the rec-
ommended  dosage  for  t-PA  is  the 
90-minute accelerated regimen.

FIGURE 52-6  Relationship  between  angiographic  assessment  of  myocardial  tissuelevel  reperfusion  categorized  by 
TIMI myocardial perfusion (TMP) grade and mortality. TMP grade 0 or no perfusion of the myocardium is associated with 
the  highest  rate  of  mortality.  If  a  stain  of  the  myocardium  is  present  (grade  1),  mortality  is  also  high.  A  reduction  in 
mortality is seen if the dye enters the microvasculature but is still persistent at the end of the washout phase (grade 2). 
The lowest mortality rate is observed in patients with normal perfusion (grade 3), with the dye being minimally persistent 
at the end of the washout phase. (From Gibson CM, Cannon CP, Murphy SA, et al: Relationship of TIMI myocardial perfu-
sion grade to mortality after administration of thrombolytic drugs. Circulation 101:125, 2000.)

Modifications  in  the  native  t-PA 
structure  have  yielded  a  group  of 
fibrinolytic  agents  with  prolonged 
plasma  clearance  that  allows  them 
to  be  administered  as  a  bolus  (Fig. 
52-9  and  Table  52-5)  rather  than  as 
the  bolus  and  infusion  by  which 
accelerated-dose  t-PA 
is  adminis-
tered.64 Reteplase (double fixed-dose 
bolus) and tenecteplase (single weight-based bolus) have both been 
compared with accelerated t-PA. Both these newer agents were asso-
ciated with mortality rates similar to that achieved with accelerated 
t-PA, but with more convenient dosing. In one large trial, tenecteplase 
was found to have a lower rate of major bleeding than accelerated 
t-PA did.

Other Fibrinolytic Agents
Streptokinase, a protein secreted by several species of streptococci, 
binds and activates human plasminogen and is an inexpensive and 
effective  fibrinolytic  agent  that  is  still  used  in  some  regions  of  the 
world. Urokinase is used for STEMI on rare occasions as an intracoro-
nary infusion.

Effect on Left Ventricular Function
As  with  survival,  improvement  in  global  left  ventricular  function  is 
related  to  the  time  of  initiation  of  fibrinolytic  treatment,  with  the 
greatest improvement occurring with the earliest therapy.2 Although 
precise measurements of infarct size would be an ideal endpoint for 
clinical reperfusion studies, such measures have proved impractical. 
Attempts to use the left ventricular ejection fraction as a surrogate for 
infarct size have not been productive because little difference is seen 
in the ejection fraction between treatment groups that show a signifi-
cant  difference  in  mortality.  Methods  of  assessing  left  ventricular 
function, such as end-systolic volume or quantitative echocardiogra-
phy, are more revealing because patients with smaller volumes and 
better-preserved ventricular shape have improved survival. The myo-
cardial salvage index, defined as the difference between the initial 
perfusion defect (e.g., by sestamibi scintigraphy) and the final perfu-
sion  defect,  is  a  useful  means  for  comparing  the  effectiveness  of 
reperfusion therapies.65 Characterization of left ventricular volumes 
concurrently  with  the  extent  of  scar  as  revealed  by  myocardial 

The  mortality  effect  of  fibrinolytic  therapy  in  elderly  patients  is  of 
considerable interest and controversy. Although patients older than 75 
years  were  initially  excluded  from  randomized  trials  of  fibrinolytic 
therapy,  they  now  constitute  approximately  15%  of  those  studied  in 
trials of fibrinolysis and approximately 35% of those analyzed in regis-
tries of patients with STEMI.61 Barriers to initiation of therapy in older 
patients  with  STEMI  include  a  protracted  period  of  delay  in  seeking 
medical  care,  a  lower  incidence  of  ischemic  discomfort  and  greater 
incidence  of  atypical  symptoms  and  concomitant  illnesses,  and  an 
increased incidence of nondiagnostic findings on the ECG.61 Younger 
patients  with  STEMI  achieve  a  slightly  greater  relative  reduction  in 
mortality than elderly patients do, but the higher absolute mortality in 
elderly patients results in similar absolute reductions in mortality.62

Several  models  have  integrated  the  many  clinical  variables  that 
affect a patients risk for mortality before the administration of fibri-
nolytic therapy. A convenient, simple, bedside risk-scoring system for 
predicting 30-day mortality at initial evaluation of fibrinolytic-eligible 
patients with STEMI was developed by Morrow by using the InTIME-II 
trial database (Fig. 52-8).63 Modeling of mortality risk cannot cover 
all clinical scenarios, however, and should supplement clinical judg-
ment in individual cases. For example, patients with inferior STEMI 
who might otherwise be considered to have a low risk for mortality 
and for whom many physicians have questioned the benefits of fibri-
nolytic therapy might be in a higher mortality risk subgroup if their 
inferior infarction is associated with right ventricular infarction, pre-
cordial ST-segment depression, or ST-segment elevation in the lateral 
precordial leads.

The  short-term  survival  benefit  enjoyed  by  patients  who  receive 
fibrinolytic  therapy  is  maintained  over  the  1-  to  10-year  follow-up. 
Room for improvement remains. Advances in adjunctive antiplatelet 
and  antithrombin  therapies  have  led  to  reductions  in  the  rate  of 
reinfarction after fibrinolysis for STEMI.2,48

characteristics  of  the  patient  and  the  fibrinolytic  agent  used  (Fig. 
52-10).1 Intracranial bleeding in the setting of fibrinolysis for STEMI 
is associated with a high case fatality rate. Nonintracranial bleeding 
can  also  result  in  increased  morbidity,  but  whether  it  is  causal  of 
higher overall mortality, after taking into account the higher-risk clini-
cal  characteristics  that  also  predispose  patients  to  bleeding  during 
treatment of STEMI, is uncertain.69,70

Reports  have  demonstrated  an  early  hazard  with  fibrinolytic 
therapythat is, an excess of deaths in the first 24 hours in fibrinolytic-
treated patients when compared with control subjects (especially in 
elderly  patients  treated  more  than  12  hours  after  symptom  onset). 
However,  this  excess  early  mortality  is  more  than  offset  by  deaths 
prevented beyond the first day, with an average 18% (range, 13% to 
23%) reduction in mortality by 35 days as compared with offering no 
reperfusion  therapy.1  The  mechanisms  responsible  for  this  early 
hazard are not clear but are probably multiple, including an increased 
risk for myocardial rupture, fatal intracranial hemorrhage, and pos-
sible myocardial reperfusion injury.

Recent  exposure  to  streptococci  or  streptokinase  produces  
some degree of antibody-mediated resistance to streptokinase (and 
anistreplase) in most patients. Although such resistance is only rarely

of clinical consequence, patients should not receive streptokinase for 
STEMI if they have been treated with a streptokinase product within 
the past 6 months.

Recommendations for Fibrinolytic Therapy
As  described  in  the  preceding  sections,  the  benefits  of  fibrinolytic 
therapy  in  patients  with  STEMI  are  well  established,  with  a  time-
dependent improvement in survival rates during the initial 12 hours 
after the onset of symptoms. When a patient arrives at a PCI-capable 
facility,  primary  PCI  is  the  preferred  mode  of  reperfusion  therapy  
(see the section Selection of Reperfusion Strategy).1,4 However, many 
health  care  facilities  do  not  have  ready  access  to  timely  PCI;  if  the 
delay from first medical contact to performing primary PCI is antici-
pated to exceed 120 minutes, administration of a fibrinolytic is indi-
cated  for  the  treatment  of  STEMI  within  12  hours  of  onset  in  the 
absence  of  contraindications.1  In  addition,  even  when  interhospital 
transport times are expected to be short, there may be advantages to 
immediate initiation of fibrinolytic therapy versus incurring any delay 
until primary PCI in patients with STEMI and low bleeding risk who 
are initially seen very early in the course.1

Choice of Agent
The choice of fibrinolytic in hospital systems is generally driven by 
the  desire  to  establish  consistent  protocols  within  the  health  care 
system by weighing ease of dosing, cost, and other institutional pref-
erences. In patients seen early with acceptable bleeding risk, a high-
intensity fibrin-specific regimen, such as accelerated t-PA, reteplase, 
or tenecteplase, is usually preferable.1 In patients whose risk for death 
is low (e.g., a young patient with a small inferior MI) and whose risk 
for  intracranial  hemorrhage  is  increased  (e.g.,  acute  hypertension), 
administration of streptokinase is reasonable, but rarely done in the 
United States. In patients who are to be treated with a fibrinolytic and 
in whom t-PA would have been selected as the agent of choice in the 
past,  we  believe  that  clinicians  should  now  consider  using  a  bolus 
fibrinolytic such as reteplase or tenecteplase. The rationale for this 
recommendation  is  that  bolus  fibrinolytics  are  easy  to  administer, 
have  a  lower  chance  of  medication  errors  (and  the  associated 
increase  in  mortality  when  such  errors  occur),  and  are  associated 
with less noncerebral bleedingas well as offering the potential for 
prehospital treatment.64

Late Therapy
No  mortality  benefit  was  demonstrated  in  the  LATE  and  EMERAS 
trials  when  fibrinolytics  were  routinely  administered  to  patients 
between 12 and 24 hours, although we believe that it is still reason-
able  to  consider  fibrinolytic  therapy  when  PCI  is  not  available  for 
appropriately  selected  patients  with  clinical  and/or  electrocardio-
graphic  evidence  of  ongoing  ischemia  within  12  to  24  hours  of 
symptom onset and a large area of myocardium at risk or hemody-
namic instability. Persistent chest pain late after the onset of symp-
toms correlates with a higher incidence of collateral or anterograde 
flow in the infarct zone and is therefore a marker for viable myocar-
dium that might be salvaged. Because elderly patients treated with 
fibrinolytic agents more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms 
have an increased risk for cardiac rupture, we believe that restricting 
late administration of a fibrinolytic to patients younger than 65 years 
with  ongoing  ischemia,  especially  those  with  large  anterior  infarc-
tions, is preferable. An elderly patient with ongoing ischemic symp-
toms  but  initially  seen  late  (>12  hours)  is  probably  better  managed 
with PCI than with fibrinolytic therapy.

General Considerations
Before  fibrinolytic  therapy  is  instituted,  consideration  should  be 
given to the patients need for intravascular catheterization, as would 
be required for placement of an arterial pressure monitoring line, a 
pulmonary artery catheter for hemodynamic monitoring, or a tempo-
rary transvenous pacemaker. If any of these are required, ideally they 
should be placed as expeditiously as possible before infusion of the 
fibrinolytic agent. If such procedures require an additional delay of 
more than 30 minutes, they should be deferred for as long as possible 

after fibrinolytic therapy is begun. In the early hours after institution 
of fibrinolytic therapy, such catheterization should be performed only 
if crucial to the patients survival, and then sites at which excessive 
bleeding can be controlled should be chosen (e.g., subclavian vein 
catheterization should be avoided).

Administration  of  anticoagulant  and  antiplatelet  agents  as  an 
adjunct to thrombolysis is discussed in detail in a subsequent section 
(see Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy).

Intracoronary Fibrinolysis
In contemporary practice, patients are more likely to be treated with 
PCI. This evolution has revived the concept of delivering fibrinolytic 
agents  via  the  intracoronary  route,  but  current  efforts  are  largely 
restricted to adjunctive use during complicated PCI procedures.71

Catheter-BasedReperfusionStrategies
(SeealsoChapter55)
Reperfusion of the infarct artery can also be achieved via a catheter-
based strategy. This approach has evolved from passage of a balloon 
catheter  over  a  guidewire  to  now  include  potent  oral  antiplatelet 
therapy,  multiple  options  for  anticoagulants,  coronary  stents,  and 
thrombectomy.1 When PCI is used as primary reperfusion therapy in 
patients with STEMI, it is referred to as direct or primary PCI (see Fig. 
52-1). After fibrinolysis has failed to reperfuse the infarct vessel or a 
severe  stenosis  is  present  in  the  infarct  vessel,  rescue  PCI  can  be 
performed  (Fig.  52-1).  A  strategy  of  routine  delayed  angiography  
and PCI after successful fibrinolytic therapy may also be considered 
(Fig.  52-1).72,73  Finally,  a  conservative  approach  of  elective  PCI  only 
when  spontaneous  or  exercise-provoked  ischemia  occurs  may  be 
used to manage patients with STEMI, regardless of whether they have 
received a previous course of fibrinolytic therapy or no initial reperfu-
sion therapy (Fig. 52-1).1 Primary PCI and the management of signifi-
cant  stenoses  in  nonculprit  coronary  arteries  are  discussed  in 
Chapter  55. This chapter discusses decision making regarding the 
selection of initial reperfusion therapy and decisions on referral for 
PCI  in  patients  who  have  undergone  initial  fibrinolysis  (see  also 
Chapter 55).

Surgical Reperfusion
Despite  the  extensive  improvement  in  intraoperative  preservation 
with  cardioplegia  and  hypothermia  and  numerous  surgical  tech-
niques,  providing  surgical  reperfusion  in  timely  fashion  is  not  
logistically  possible.  Therefore  patients  with  STEMI  who  are  candi-
dates  for  reperfusion  should  undergo  either  fibrinolysis  or  PCI. 
However,  patients  with  STEMI  are  currently  referred  for  coronary 
artery  bypass  grafting  (CABG)  for  one  of  the  following  indications: 
persistent  or  recurrent  ischemia  despite  fibrinolysis  or  primary  PCI 
with  residual  coronary  disease  not  amenable  to  PCI,  high-risk  
coronary anatomy (e.g., left main stenosis) discovered at initial cath-
eterization,  or  a  complication  of  STEMI  such  as  ventricular  septal 
rupture  or  severe  mitral  regurgitation  caused  by  papillary  muscle 
dysfunction.  STEMI  patients  with  continued  severe  ischemic  and 
hemodynamic  instability  will  probably  benefit  from  emergency 
revascularization.

Patients  who  successfully  undergo  fibrinolysis  but  have  important 
residual stenoses and on anatomic grounds are more suitable for surgi-
cal  revascularization  than  for  PCI  have  undergone  CABG  with  quite 
low rates of mortality (4%) and morbidity, provided that the proce-
dure is carried out more than 24 hours after STEMI; patients requiring 
urgent or emergency CABG within 24 to 48 hours of STEMI have mortal-
ity  rates  between  12%  and  15%.1  When  surgery  is  performed  under 
urgent  conditions  with  active  and  ongoing  ischemia  or  cardiogenic 
shock, operative mortality rates are higher, in large part reflecting the 
patients overall condition that necessitated emergency surgery.

SelectionofReperfusionStrategy
When  performed  rapidly  after  arrival  at  an  experienced  center, 
primary  PCI  is  superior  to  pharmacologic  reperfusion  therapy.1,74,75

Nevertheless,  decision  making  for  individual  patients  remains 
complex regarding the optimum form of reperfusion therapy when a 
delay until PCI can be performed is anticipated, such as in centers 
without  24-hour  availability  of  primary  PCI.1  This  controversy  has 
been difficult to resolve in the context of a dynamic evidence base 
and the absence of adequately powered definitive trials of reperfu-
sion in patients with STEMI when immediate primary PCI is not an 
option.  Moreover,  newer  fibrinolytic  agents  and  combinations  of 
adjunctive  treatments  have  improved  medical  measures  to  restore 
and maintain flow in the infarct artery (Fig. 52-11). At the same time, 
improvements in catheterization laboratory facilities, new stents, evo-
lution  of  adjunctive  antithrombotic  therapy,  thrombus  aspiration 
devices, and the development of collaborative systems for rapid trans-
fer  for  invasive  therapy  have  improved  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
primary PCI in patients with STEMI, including those being transferred 
for  primary  PCI  (see  Chapter  55).76  High-volume  operators  and 
centers  can  consistently  achieve  better  outcomes  in  patients  with 
STEMI.77 Selection of the optimal form of reperfusion therapy there-
fore  involves  judgments  regarding  both  system  resources  and  indi-
vidual patient characteristics.

For  patients  who  arrive  at  an  experienced  primary  PCI  center, 
primary PCI should be performed in those with STEMI who are seen 
within 12 hours of symptom onset and those with later arrival who 
have ongoing ischemia or shock. In patients taken to centers that are 
not PCI capable, the following issues should be considered in choos-
ing the approach to reperfusion (see Fig. 52-1 and Table 52-4):
1.  Time  from  onset  of  symptoms  to  initiation  of  reperfusion  therapy: 
PCI  is  preferable  in  patients  with  late  arrival,  particularly  those 
initially seen more than 12 hours after symptom onset.

2.  Risk for death after STEMI: The mortality benefit associated with 
PCI is largest in patients at highest risk for mortality; the mortality 
benefit  of  PCI  decreases  progressively  as  the  patients  risk  for 
death from STEMI decreases such that the mortality advantage of 

PCI is no longer evident in patients whose 30-day mortality rate is 
estimated  to  be  between  2%  and  3%  if  treated  with  fibrinolytic 
therapy.

3.  Presence  of  shock:  Patients  in  cardiogenic  shock  have  improved 
survival if they are treated with an early revascularization strategy 
(PCI and/or CABG as indicated).

4.  Risk for bleeding: In patients with an increased risk for bleeding, 
particularly intracranial hemorrhage, therapeutic decision making 
strongly favors a PCI-based reperfusion strategy (see Fig. 52-10). If 
PCI  is  unavailable,  the  benefit  of  pharmacologic  reperfusion 
should be balanced against the risk for bleeding. A decision analy-
sis  suggests  that  when  PCI  is  not  available,  fibrinolytic  therapy 
should still be favored over no reperfusion treatment until the risk 
for life-threatening bleeding exceeds 4%.

5.  Time required for transportation to a skilled PCI center: The greatest 
operational impediment to routine implementation of a PCI reper-
fusion strategy is the delay required for transportation to a skilled 
PCI center (Fig.  52-12; also see Fig. 52-1 and Table 52-1).78 Trials 
conducted in health care systems with extremely short transporta-
tion and door-to-balloon times at PCI centers have demonstrated 
that referral to a PCI center can be superior to fibrinolysis admin-
istered  at  a  local  hospital.78,79  If  the  delay  to  implementation  of 
primary PCI is substantial, however, the mortality advantage over 
administration of a fibrin-specific agent is lost. The best estimate 
of the time delay at which this advantage is lost is 1 to 2 hours, but 
it may vary depending on the timing of initial evaluation and the 
extent of myocardium at risk.78
Based  on  the  aforementioned  considerations,  clinicians  should 
make an integrated assessment of the time since the onset of symp-
toms (see Figs. 52-1, 52-2, and 52-3), risk for death after STEMI (see 
Fig. 52-8), risk for bleeding if a fibrinolytic is administered (see Fig. 
52-10),  and  time  required  for  transportation  to  a  skilled  PCI  center 
(see  Fig.  52-1  and  52-3).  Reducing  this  decision  making  to  a

one-size-fits-all approach is not possible. Primary PCI is generally 
preferred, except when a patient with low bleeding risk arrives very 
early after the onset of symptoms (1 to 2 hours) at a nonPCI-capable 
hospital and the delay in transfer for primary PCI is anticipated to be 
long (Fig. 52-12). When fibrinolysis is performed early, particularly in 
the prehospital setting, and is followed by coronary angiography and 
PCI when appropriate, the 1-year survival rate is comparable to that 
achieved  with  primary  PCI.80  Importantly,  when  the  diagnosis  of 
STEMI is in doubt, an invasive strategy is clearly the preferred strategy 
because it not only provides key diagnostic information regarding the 
patients symptoms but does so without the risk for intracranial hem-
orrhage associated with fibrinolysis.

Referral for Angiography with the Intent of 
Revascularization after Initial Fibrinolysis
Patients  with  STEMI  who  are  initially  managed  by  fibrinolysis  at  a 
nonPCI-capable center may be appropriate for transfer for coronary 
angiography  because  of  the  development  of  cardiogenic  shock  or 
severe  heart  failure,  for  failed  reperfusion  with  a  fibrinolytic,  or  as 
part  of  an  invasive  strategy  in  stable  patients  with  the  intention  of 
performing PCI 3 to 24 hours after fibrinolysis (Table 52-6; also see 
Fig. 52-1). Performance of PCI in patients with STEMI and shock has 
been discussed.

Studies  of  patients  undergoing  angiography  and  PCI  after  sus-
pected  failure  of  reperfusion  with  fibrinolysis  have  demonstrated  a 
trend  toward  a  lower  mortality  rate  and  significantly  lower  rates  of 
recurrent MI and heart failure in those treated with rescue PCI versus 
continued medical therapy, including readministration of a fibrino-
lytic  agent.  In  the  REACT  (Rapid  Early  Action  for  Coronary  Treat-
ment) study, patients with suspected failed reperfusion at 90 minutes 
by  electrocardiographic  criteria  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of 
three  treatment  arms:  rescue  PCI,  conservative  care,  or  repeated 
fibrinolytic therapy. The composite of death, reinfarction, stroke, or 
severe  heart  failure  at  6  months  was  significantly  lower  in  patients 
randomly  assigned  to  rescue  PCI  than  in  the  two  other  treatment 
groups.1  More  minor  bleeding,  however,  occurred  in  patients  ran-
domly assigned to rescue PCI.

The  option  of  administration  of  a  fibrinolytic  agent  at  nonPCI-
capable hospitals, followed by routine transfer for angiography and 
PCI if indicated, has been advanced as an attractive strategy to offer 
timely  reperfusion  therapy  and  arrange  a  nonemergency  transfer 

for subsequent procedures to reduce the risk for subsequent reinfarc-
tion. This approach is supported indirectly by retrospective analyses 
of trials of fibrinolytic therapy that suggest a lower risk for recurrent 
MI  and  a  lower  2-year  mortality  rate  in  patients  who  subsequently 
undergo early PCI. The limited randomized trials evaluating a strat-
egy of routine catheterization after fibrinolysis have provided mixed 
results.  Nevertheless,  overall,  these  trials  have  suggested  improve-
ment in clinical outcomes in patients transferred for early catheteriza-
tion, particularly those at higher risk for death and recurrent ischemia 
(Fig. 52-13).1 In the largest of these studies, TRANSFER-AMI (Trial of 
Routine Angioplasty and Stenting after Fibrinolysis to Enhance Reper-
fusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction; N = 1059), immediate transfer 
for angiography versus conservative care reduced the composite end-
point of death, recurrent MI, recurrent ischemia, new or worsening 
heart failure, or shock at 30 days.73 In a meta-analysis that included 
seven randomized trials of early transfer for catheterization, a strat-
egy of routine early catheterization after fibrinolysis was associated 
with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of death or 
MI at 30 days and at 1 year without an increase in the risk for major 
bleeding.81 Notably, the clinical trials that assessed routine invasive 
evaluation after initial fibrinolysis used a time window of 0 to 24 hours 
for  the  early  invasive  strategy,  thus  supporting  earlier  transfer  
after administration of fibrinolytic therapy, even for patients without 
high-risk  features.  Although  we  believe  that  there  will  probably  be 
continued  benefit  even  beyond  24  hours  in  patients  with  a  patent  
but  stenotic  infarct  artery  after  initial  successful  reperfusion,  later 
time  windows  have  not  been  directly  examined.  Because  of  the  
associated increased bleeding risk, very early (<2 to 3 hours) cathe-
terization  after  the  administration  of  fibrinolytic  therapy  with  the 
intent  to  perform  revascularization  should  be  reserved  for  patients 
with evidence of failed fibrinolysis and significant myocardial jeop-
ardy,  for  whom  rescue  PCI  would  be  appropriate.  In  addition,  
when  STEMI  is  suspected  to  have  occurred  by  a  mechanism  other 
than thrombotic occlusion at the site of atherosclerotic plaque, coro-
nary  angiography  may  provide  diagnostic  information  and  direct 
specific therapy.

In summary, delayed coronary angiography with PCI of the infarct 
artery  is  indicated  in  patients  initially  treated  with  a  noninvasive 
strategy  (i.e.,  with  fibrinolysis  or  without  reperfusion  therapy)  who 
become unstable after cardiogenic shock, acute severe heart failure, 
or  unstable  postinfarction  angina  develops,  provided  that  invasive 
management  is  not  considered  futile  or  inappropriate  (Table  52-6). 
Delayed PCI also appears to be reasonable 
in  patients  with  failed  fibrinolysis  or  reoc-
clusion of the infarct artery or in those who 
demonstrate  significant  residual  ischemia 
during hospitalization after initial noninva-
sive  management.  The  benefits  of  routine 
(nonischemia-driven)  PCI  on  an  angio-
graphically  significant  stenosis  in  a  patent 
infarct  artery  more  than  24  hours  after 
STEMI  are 
less  well  established,  and 
delayed  PCI  on  a  totally  occluded  infarct 
artery  longer  than  24  hours  after  STEMI 
should  not  be  undertaken  in  clinically 
stable  patients  without  evidence  of  severe 
ischemia.1

Patients Not Eligible for 
Reperfusion Therapy
Aspirin  and  antithrombin  therapy  can  be 
prescribed for patients who are not candi-
dates for acute reperfusion because of lack 
of availability of PCI and contraindications 
to  fibrinolysis.  In  the  setting  of  absolute 
contraindications to fibrinolysis (see Table 
52-4)  and  lack  of  access  to  PCI  facilities, 
antithrombotic therapy should be initiated 
because  of  the  small  but  finite  chance

ing the chance of thrombotic complications of STEMI.

AnticoagulantandAntiplateletTherapy
Anticoagulant Therapy
The  rationale  for  administering  anticoagulant  therapy  acutely  to 
patients with STEMI includes establishing and maintaining patency 
of the infarct-related artery, regardless of whether a patient receives 
fibrinolytic therapy (Fig. 52-14), and preventing deep venous throm-
bosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  ventricular  thrombus  formation,  and 
cerebral embolization.

Effect of Heparin on Mortality
Randomized trials of patients with STEMI conducted in the prefibri-
nolytic  era  showed  a  lower  risk  for  reinfarction,  pulmonary  embo-
lism,  and  stroke  in  those  who  received  intravenous  heparin,  thus

of a longitudinal section of an infarct-related artery at the level of the obstructive thrombus. Following rupture of a 
vulnerable  plaque  (bottom  center),  the  coagulation  cascade  is  activated,  which  ultimately  leads  to  the  deposition  of 
fibrin strands; platelets are activated and begin to aggregate. Platelets that aggregate with incorporation of relatively 
few red cells form a white thrombus. The mesh of fibrin strands and platelet aggregates obstructs flow in the infarct-
related artery. Pharmacologic reperfusion is a multipronged approach consisting of fibrinolytic agents that digest fibrin, 
anticoagulants  that  prevent  the  formation  of  thrombin  and  inhibit  the  activity  of  formed  thrombin,  and  antiplatelet 
therapy. (Modified from Jackson SP: Arterial thrombosisinsidious, unpredictable, and deadly. Nat Med 17:1423, 2011.)

HIRUDIN  AND  BIVALIRUDIN.  In 
patients undergoing fibrinolysis, direct 
thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin or 
bivalirudin  reduce  the  incidence  of 
recurrent MI by 25% to 30% when com-
pared  with  heparin  but  have  not 
reduced  mortality.  In  addition,  both 
hirudin  and  bivalirudin  cause  higher 
rates  of  major  bleeding  than  heparin 
does  when  used  with  fibrinolytic 
agents.85  In  contrast,  when  adminis-
tered  for  a  short  period  as  an  adjunct 
to  primary  PCI  in  the  HORIZONS-AMI 
(Harmonizing  Outcomes  with  Revas-
cularization  and  Stents  in  Acute  Myo-
cardial 
trial,  bivalirudin 
(open label), versus heparin plus glyco-
protein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, resulted 
in  a  reduced  30-day  rate  of  major 
bleeding  or  major  adverse  cardiovas-
cular events, including death, reinfarc-
tion, target vessel revascularization for 
ischemia,  and  stroke  (RR,  0.76;  95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P 
=  0.005),  driven  by  a  significant  40% 
reduction  in  major  bleeding.  Impor-
tantly,  treatment  with  bivalirudin  sig-
nificantly reduced mortality at 30 days 
and at 1 year (Fig. 52-15).86 Bivalirudin 
was  associated  with  an  increased  early  risk  for  stent  thrombosis,  
thus demonstrating an early trade-off of bleeding and antithrombotic 
efficacy.87  Additional  studies  have  observed  this  increased  early 
risk for stent thrombosis, with mixed results in terms of bleeding.87a,87b
low-
molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) include a stable, reliable anti-
coagulant  effect,  high  bioavailability  permitting  administration  via 
the subcutaneous route, and a high anti-Xatoanti-IIa ratio produc-
ing blockade of the coagulation cascade in an upstream location and 
resulting in a marked decrement in thrombin generation. When com-
pared with unfractionated heparin, the rate of early (60 to 90 minutes) 
reperfusion of the infarct artery, assessed either angiographically or 
by  noninvasive  means,  is  not  enhanced  by  the  administration  of 
LMWH.  Rates  of  reocclusion  of  the  infarct  artery,  reinfarction,  or 
recurrent  ischemic  events,  however,  appear  to  be  reduced  with 
LMWH.88 This effect may underlie the significant reduction in recur-
rent MI with a strategy of extended anticoagulation with LMWHs, or 
a factor Xa antagonist versus standard therapy, in patients with STEMI 
undergoing fibrinolysis.

LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT  HEPARINS.  Advantages  of 

When compared with placebo, the LMWH reviparin significantly 
reduced the incidence of death, recurrent MI, or stroke at 30 days in 
15,570  patients  with  STEMI,  73%  of  whom  received  a  fibrinolytic  
(predominantly a nonfibrin-specific agent).89 This important finding 
demonstrates not only that LMWHs are clinically effective for STEMI 
but also that a clinical anticoagulant therapy provides benefit as part 
of a pharmacologic reperfusion strategy in the fibrinolytic era.89

Several trials have compared a LMWH with unfractionated heparin 
as  part  of  a  pharmacologic  reperfusion  strategy  and  demonstrated 
the LMWH to be superior.89 In the ASSENT (Assessment of the Safety 
and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic) 3 trial, enoxaparin (30-mg intra-
venous bolus, followed by subcutaneous injections of 1 mg/kg every 
12 hours until discharge from the hospital)90 reduced 30-day mortal-
ity,  in-hospital  reinfarction,  or  in-hospital  refractory  ischemia  when 
compared  with  unfractionated  heparin  (RR,  0.74;  95%  CI,  0.63  to 
0.87).  The  rate  of  intracranial  hemorrhage  was  similar  with  unfrac-
tionated  heparin  and  enoxaparin  (0.93%  versus  0.88%;  P  =  0.98). 
The  ExTRACT-TIMI  25  (Enoxaparin  and  Thrombolysis  Reperfusion  
for Acute Myocardial Infarction TreatmentThrombolysis in Myocar-
dial  Infarction  [25])  trial  tested  in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy 
design  the  hypothesis  that  a  strategy  of  enoxaparin  (adjusted  for  
age  and  renal  function)  administered  for  the  duration  of  the  index 

substantial reduction in mortality with aspirin alone and confusing 
and conflicting data regarding the risk-benefit ratio of heparin used 
as an adjunct to aspirin or in combination with aspirin and a fibrino-
lytic agent.1 Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of trials in the fibrinolytic 
era suggested that for every 1000 patients treated with heparin versus 
aspirin alone, five fewer deaths (P = 0.03) and three fewer recurrent 
infarctions (P = 0.04) occur, but at the expense of three more major 
bleeding episodes (P = 0.001).82

OTHER EFFECTS OF HEPARIN.  Several angiographic studies have 
examined the role of heparin therapy in establishing and maintaining 
patency of the infarct-related artery in patients with STEMI. Although 
evidence  favoring  the  use  of  heparin  for  enhancing  patency  of  the 
infarct artery when a fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agent is prescribed is 
not conclusive, the suggestion of a mortality benefit and amelioration 
of left ventricular thrombi after STEMI indicates that use of heparin 
for at least 48 hours after fibrinolysis is prudent.1

The most serious complication of anticoagulant therapy is bleed-
ing  (see  Chapter  82),  especially  intracranial  hemorrhage,  when 
fibrinolytic  agents  are  prescribed.83  Major  hemorrhagic  events 
occur more frequently in patients with low body weight, advanced 
age, female sex, marked prolongation of the activated partial throm-
boplastin  time  (APTT)  (>90  to  100  seconds),  and  performance 
of  invasive  procedures.  Frequent  monitoring  of  the  APTT  reduces  
the  risk  for  major  hemorrhagic  complications  in  patients  treated  
with  heparin.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  during  the  first  
12  hours  following  fibrinolytic  therapy,  the  APTT  may  be  elevated  
as  a  result  of  the  fibrinolytic  agent  alone  (particularly  if  streptoki-

is  administered),  thus  making 

Newer Antithrombotic Agents
Potential  disadvantages  of  unfractionated  heparin  include  depen-
dency on antithrombin III for inhibition of thrombin activity, sensitiv-
ity to platelet factor 4, inability to inhibit clot-bound thrombin, marked 
interpatient variability in therapeutic response, and the need for fre-
quent monitoring of the APTT. Even with standardized weight-based 
dosing nomograms, less than 35% of initial APTT measurements are 
within the therapeutic range.84 An effort to circumvent these disad-
vantages  of  unfractionated  heparin  has  stimulated  interest  in  the 
development of alternative anticoagulants.

compared fondaparinux given for 8 days with 
placebo  in  patients  when  the  treating  physi-
cian thought that unfractionated heparin was 
not indicated (stratum I) and with unfraction-
ated  heparin  for  48  hours  when  the  treating 
physician  thought  that  heparin  was  indicated 
(stratum  II).  Fondaparinux  reduced  the  com-
posite  of  death  or  reinfarction  in  stratum  I 
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.92), 
but not in stratum II (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81 to 
1.13).  Thus  fondaparinux  was  superior  to 
placebo (stratum I) but yielded results similar 
to those achieved with unfractionated heparin 
(stratum II). The outcome of patients in stratum 
II who underwent PCI tended to be worse when 
fondaparinux was used than when unfraction-
ated heparin was used, probably because of an 
increased risk for catheter thrombosis.

Recommendations for  
Anticoagulant Therapy

ANTICOAGULATION  WITH  FIBRINOLY-
SIS.  Given the pivotal role of thrombin in the 
pathogenesis of STEMI, antithrombotic therapy 
remains  an  important  intervention  (see  Fig. 
55-14). A regimen of an intravenous unfraction-
ated heparin bolus of 60 units/kg to a maximum 
of 4000 units, followed by an initial infusion at 
12 units/kg/hr to a maximum of 1000 units/hr 
for 48 hours, adjusted to maintain the APTT at 
1.5  to  2  times  control  (50  to  70  seconds),  is 
effective 
in  patients  receiving  fibrinolytic 
therapy.  However,  infusions  of  unfractionated 
heparin  are  cumbersome  to  administer  and 
provide  unreliable  levels  of  anticoagulation 
that  require  frequent  measurements  of  the 
APTT to adjust the infusion rate.93 In addition, 
because of the risk for heparin-induced throm-
bocytopenia with prolonged administration of 
unfractionated heparin, alternative anticoagu-
lant regimens are preferred if administered for 
longer than 48 hours.1

in patients with STEMI. A, Treatment with bivalirudin was associated with significantly lower rates of major 
bleeding and mortality at 30 days. B, Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac 
events (MACEs) did not differ between the two strategies at 30 days. C, Acute stent thrombosis during the 
first 24 hours was higher in patients treated with bivalirudin alone, but cardiovascular mortality was reduced 
in the bivalirudin group after 1 year of follow-up, thus providing strong evidence for this treatment strategy.

infarction. N Engl J Med 358:2218, 2008; and Mehran R, Lansky AJ, Witzenbichler B: Bivalirudin in patients

hospitalization was superior to the conventional antithrombin strat-
egy  of  administration  of  unfractionated  heparin  for  48  hours  after 
fibrinolysis.91 The primary endpoint of death or recurrent nonfatal MI 
through  30  days  was  reduced  by  17%  (P = 0.001;  Fig.  52-16A)  with 
enoxaparin  as  compared  with  unfractionated  heparin,  with  a  33% 
reduction  (P = 0.001)  in  reinfarction  and  a  nonsignificant  favorable 
trend on overall mortality (P = 0.11). This improvement in recurrent 
MI was balanced against an increase in the incidence of major bleed-
ing (1.4% and 2.1%, P = 0.001). In a meta-analysis of trials of LMWH 
versus unfractionated heparin, LMWH clearly reduced recurrent MI 
but with a pattern of increased bleeding (Fig. 52-16B).

PARENTERAL FACTOR Xa ANTAGONISTS.  The OASIS-6 (Organi-
zation for the Assessment of Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes) trial 
evaluated  the  specific  factor  Xa  antagonist  fondaparinux  (2.5 mg 
subcutaneously)  in  12,092  patients  with  STEMI.92  The  trial  design 

Both the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 and OASIS-6 trials 
indicated that prolonged administration of an 
anticoagulant  for  the  duration  of  hospitaliza-
tion is beneficial when compared with the pre-
vious practice of administering unfractionated 
heparin only for 48 hours unless clear-cut indi-
cations  for  continued  anticoagulation  were 
present.  Accordingly,  patients  managed  with 
pharmacologic  reperfusion  therapy  should 
receive  anticoagulant  therapy  for  a  minimum 
of  48  hours  and  preferably  for  the  duration  of  hospitalization  after 
STEMI, up to 8 days. Enoxaparin or fondaparinux is preferred when 
administration of an anticoagulant for longer than 48 hours is planned 
in patients with STEMI treated with a fibrinolytic.1 Enoxaparin should 
be administered according to age, weight, and creatinine clearance 
and  be  given  as  an  intravenous  bolus,  followed  in  15  minutes  by 
subcutaneous injection for the duration of the index hospitalization, 
up  to  8  days  or  until  revascularization.  Fondaparinux  should  be 
administered as an initial intravenous dose, followed in 24 hours by 
daily subcutaneous injections if the estimated creatinine clearance 
is higher than 30 mL/min. If PCI is performed in a patient treated with 
fondaparinux, coadministration of an additional antithrombin agent 
with antifactor IIa activity is required.

In patients with a known history of heparin-induced thrombocyto-
penia,  bivalirudin  in  conjunction  with  streptokinase  is  a  useful

alternative  to  heparin.1  For  patients  who  are  referred  for  CABG, 
unfractionated heparin is the preferred antithrombin. When an alter-
native  antithrombin  has  been  used,  it  should  be  discontinued  at  a 
sufficiently long interval before surgery to avoid double anticoagula-
tion when the patient enters the operating room and receives unfrac-
tionated heparin.

ADJUNCTIVE ANTICOAGULATION FOR PRIMARY PERCUTANE-
OUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (See Chapter 55).  Either unfrac-
tionated heparin or bivalirudin is recommended as an anticoagulant 
to support primary PCI, with bivalirudin being preferred in patients 
at high risk for bleeding.1,86 Fondaparinux is not recommended as the 
sole anticoagulant in this setting.1 LMWH has not had sufficient evalu-
ation  in  primary  PCI  to  formulate  recommendations  for  treatment. 
Some investigators who have used enoxaparin to support primary PCI 
for  STEMI  administer  0.5 mg/kg  intravenously  at  the  time  of  the 
procedure.

PATIENTS  TREATED  WITHOUT  REPERFUSION  THERAPY.  Treat-
ment with an anticoagulant is reasonable, and agents shown to be 
more  effective  than  unfractionated  heparin  in  other  groups  with 
STEMI  may  be  preferable.  For  example,  in  patients  with  STEMI  not 
receiving reperfusion therapy, fondaparinux reduces the composite 

of death or recurrent MI without an increase in severe bleeding when 
compared with placebo or unfractionated heparin.94

Antiplatelet Therapy
Platelets play a major role in the response to disruption of coronary 
artery plaque, especially in the early phase of thrombus formation. 
Platelets  are  also  activated  in  response  to  fibrinolysis,  and  platelet-
rich  thrombi  are  more  resistant  to  fibrinolysis  than  are  fibrin  and 
erythrocyte-rich  thrombi  (see  Fig.  52-14).  Thus  a  sound  scientific 
basis  exists  for  inhibiting  platelet  aggregation  in  all  patients  with 
STEMI, regardless of the reperfusion management strategy. The agent 
most extensively tested has been aspirin, and treatment with aspirin 
and a second antiplatelet agentsuch as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or 
ticagrelorhas become the standard of care for patients with STEMI.

Antiplatelet Therapy with Fibrinolysis
The  ISIS-2  study  was  the  largest  trial  of  aspirin  in  patients  with 
STEMI; it provided the single strongest piece of evidence that aspirin 
reduces  mortality  in  such  patients.95  In  contrast  to  the  observations 
of a time-dependent mortality effect of fibrinolytic therapy, the reduc-
tion in mortality with aspirin was similar in patients treated within 4 
hours  (25%  reduction  in  mortality),  between  5  and  12  hours  (21% 
reduction), and between 13 and 24 hours (21% reduction). An overall 
23%  reduction  in  mortality  with  aspirin  occurred  in  ISIS-2  that  was 
largely additive to the 25% reduction in mortality from streptokinase, 
so patients receiving both therapies experienced a 42% reduction in 
mortality.  The  reduction  in  mortality  was  as  high  as  53%  in  patients 
who  received  both  aspirin  and  streptokinase  within  6  hours  of 
symptoms.

Obstructive platelet-rich arterial thrombi resist fibrinolysis and have 
an increased tendency for reocclusion after initial successful reperfu-
sion  in  patients  with  STEMI.  Despite  inhibition  of  cyclooxygenase 
(COX) by aspirin, platelet activation leading to platelet aggregation and 
increased  thrombin  formation  continues  through  thromboxane  A2
independent  pathways.21  Adding  other  antiplatelet  agents  to  aspirin 
has  benefited  patients  with  STEMI.  Inhibitors  of  the  P2Y12  adenosine 
diphosphate receptor help prevent the activation and aggregation of 
platelets. In the CLARITY-TIMI (Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion 
TherapyThrombolysis  in  Myocardial  Infarction)  28  trial,  addition  of 
the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel to background treatment with aspirin in 
patients  with  STEMI  who  were  younger  than  75  years  and  received 
fibrinolytic therapy reduced the risk for clinical events (death, reinfarc-
tion, stroke) and reocclusion of a successfully reperfused infarct artery 
(Fig.  52-17).96  An  ST  Resolution  (STRes)  electrocardiographic  sub-
study from CLARITY-TIMI 28 provided insight into the mechanism of 
the benefit of clopidogrel in STEMI. No difference was seen in the rate 
of complete STRes between the clopidogrel and placebo groups at 90 
minutes (38.4% versus 36.6%). When patients were stratified by STRes 
category, treatment with clopidogrel resulted in greater benefit in those 
with  evidence  of  early  STRes,  with  greater  odds  of  having  an  open 
artery at late angiography in patients with partial (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 
P = 0.04) or complete (OR, 2; P = 0.001) STRes, but no improvement in 
those with no STRes evident at 90 minutes (OR, 0.89; P = 0.48) (P for 
interaction = 0.003). Clopidogrel was also associated with a significant 
reduction  in  the  odds  for  in-hospital  death  or  MI  in  patients  who 
achieved partial (OR, 0.30; P = 0.003) or complete STRes at 90 minutes 
(OR,  0.49;  P = 0.056),  whereas  clinical  benefit  was  not  apparent  in 
patients  who  had  no  STRes  (OR,  0.98;  P = 0.95)  (P  for  interaction  = 
0.027).  Thus  it  appears  that  clopidogrel  did  not  increase  the  rate  of 
complete  opening  of  occluded  infarct  arteries  when  fibrinolysis  was 
administered but was highly effective in preventing reocclusion of an 
initially reperfused infarct artery.

In COMMIT (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction 
Trial), 45,852 patients with suspected MI were randomly assigned to 
clopidogrel, 75 mg/day (without a loading dose), or placebo in addi-
tion to aspirin, 162 mg/day (Fig. 52-17).96 Patients in the clopidogrel 
group had a lower rate of the composite endpoint of death, reinfarc-
tion, or stroke (9.2% versus 10.1%; P = 0.002). They also had a signifi-
cantly lower rate of death (7.5% versus 8.1%; P = 0.03). No excessive 
bleeding with clopidogrel occurred in this trial.

Combination Pharmacologic Reperfusion
Several studies evaluated the combination of platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhib-
itors and fibrinolytics. Trials of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors combined with 
either full or reduced doses of fibrinolytics showed improvements in 
reperfusion, including myocardial perfusion as reflected in enhanced 
ST-segment  resolution  and 
frame  counts. 
However,  subsequent  large  outcomes  trials  revealed  no  significant 
effect on survival and reductions in reinfarction that were outweighed

tor  and  a  fibrinolytic  as  a  pharmacologic  reperfusion  regimen  is 
therefore not recommended.1

Antiplatelet Therapy for Percutaneous Coronary 
Intervention in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction  
(See Chapter 55)
All  patients  with  STEMI  should  receive  aspirin  as  soon  as  possible 
after initial encounter in the absence of contraindications. Adding the 
P2Y12  inhibitor  clopidogrel  to  aspirin  appears  to  offer  additional 
benefit  in  patients  undergoing  PCI  after  STEMI.  An  analysis  of  the 
subgroup of patients who underwent PCI in the CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial 
showed that pretreatment with clopidogrel significantly reduced the 
incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke following PCI (3.6% 
versus 6.2%; P = 0.008).1,97 Pretreatment with clopidogrel also reduced 
the incidence of MI or stroke before PCI (4% versus 6.2%; P = 0.03). 
There was no significant excess in rates of TIMI major or minor bleed-
ing  (2%  versus  1.9%;  P = 0.99).  As  part  of  the  PCI-CLARITY 
(PCI-Clopidogrel  as  Adjunctive  Reperfusion  Therapy)  study,  the 
investigators  performed  a  meta-analysis  of  PCI-CLARITY,  PCI-CURE 
(PCI-Clopidogrel  in  Unstable  angina  to  prevent  Recurrent  Events), 
and  CREDO  (Clopidogrel  for  the  Reduction  of  Events  During  
Observation)  and  found  that  pretreatment  with  clopidogrel  signifi-
cantly  reduced  the  risk  for  30-day  cardiovascular  death  or  MI.  A 
subsequent  meta-analysis  included  data  from  randomized  trials  
and registries of patients with CAD (stable or with an ACS) undergo-
ing  catheterization  for  potential  revascularization  to  evaluate  the 
association  between  pretreatment  with  clopidogrel  and  outcomes 
after PCI. Higher-risk STEMI patients had a lower risk for major coro-
nary  events  with  clopidogrel  pretreatment,  but  not  a  reduction  in 
mortality or an increase in bleeding.98 Regarding dose, in CURRENT-
OASIS-7  (Clopidogrel  and  Aspirin  Optimal  Dose  Usage  to  Reduce 
Recurrent  EventsSeventh  Organization  to  Assess  Strategies  in  
Ischemic Syndromes), which included a population in which 29% had 
STEMI,  doubling  the  standard  dose  of  clopidogrel  (loading  dose  
of 600 mg, daily dose of 150 mg) for the first 7 days did not improve 
outcome  in  the  overall  ACS  population  referred  for  an  invasive  
strategy,  but  there  was  benefit  in  ACS  patients  who  actually  under-
went PCI.99,100

In  patients  undergoing  either  primary  PCI  or  delayed  PCI  after 
initial  therapy  for  STEMI,  the  more  potent  P2Y12  inhibitor  prasugrel 
has been superior to clopidogrel in reducing the risk for cardiovas-
cular death, MI, or stroke.101 In the subgroup of patients with STEMI 
enrolled in TRITON-TIMI 38 (TRial to Assess Improvement in Thera-
peutic  Outcomes  by  Optimizing  Platelet  InhibitioN  with  Prasugrel
Thrombolysis  In  Myocardial  Infarction)  (N  =  3534),  this  endpoint 
was  lowered  by  32%  at  30  days  with  prasugrel  as  compared  with 
aspirin  (6.5%  versus  9.5%;  P  =  0.0017)  and  by  21%  at  15  months 
(10.0%  versus  12.4%;  P  =  0.022)  (Fig.  52-18).102  Prasugrel  reduced 
definite  or  probable  stent  thrombosis  by  42%  when  compared  with 
clopidogrel.102  Analogously,  in  the  PLATO  (Platelet  Inhibition  and 
Patient Outcomes) trial, when compared with clopidogrel, treatment 
with  the  reversible  P2Y12  inhibitor  ticagrelor  in  patients  with  STEMI 
undergoing  primary  PCI  (N  =  7544)  tended  to  reduce  the  primary 
endpoint of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, or stroke by 13%, a 
magnitude similar to that for the overall trial population (Fig. 52-18); 
there was a 26% reduction in definite or probable stent thrombosis 
and an 18% reduction in all-cause mortality also occurred.103 A dis-
cussion  of  the  use  of  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors  as  part  of  adjunctive 
therapy  for  patients  with  STEMI  undergoing  PCI  is  presented  in 
Chapter 55.

Recommendations for Antiplatelet Therapy
Patients who have not taken aspirin before the development of STEMI 
should chew nonenteric-coated aspirin, and the dose should be 162 
to  325 mg  initially.  During  the  maintenance  phase  of  antiplatelet 
therapy following STEMI, the dose of aspirin is preferably reduced to 
75  to  162 mg  to  minimize  the  risk  for  bleeding.1  Lower  doses  are 
preferable  because  of  the  increased  risk  for  bleeding  with  higher

nary  syndromes  intended  for  reperfusion  with  primary  percutaneous  coronary  intervention:  A  Platelet  Inhibition  and  Patient  Outcomes  (PLATO)  trial  subgroup  analysis.

doses reported in several studies; the CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial did not 
find differences in terms of efficacy or safety in STEMI patients ran-
domly assigned to 81 versus 325 mg of aspirin. If true aspirin allergy 
is present, other antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel or ticlopidine 
can be substituted.

The  addition  of  a  P2Y12  inhibitor  to  aspirin  is  warranted  in  most 
patients  with  STEMI.1  Based  on  the  results  of  the  COMMIT  and 
CLARITY-TIMI 28 trials, clopidogrel, 75 mg/day orally, is an option for 
all patients with STEMI regardless of whether they receive fibrinolytic 
therapy, undergo primary PCI, or do not receive reperfusion therapy. 
The data available suggest that a loading dose of 300 mg of clopido-
grel should be given to patients younger than 75 years who receive 
fibrinolytic therapy. Data are insufficient in elderly patients to recom-
mend  a  loading  dose  in  those  75  years  or  older  who  receive  a 
fibrinolytic.

When  primary  PCI  is  the  mode  of  reperfusion  therapy,  an  oral 
loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel before stent implantation is an 
established  treatment,  followed  by  75 mg  daily.1,6  Notably,  interpa-
tient  variability  in  the  response  to  clopidogrel  can  occur,  and  indi-
viduals with lesser degrees of platelet inhibition are at increased risk 
for death and ischemic complications.104 One potential source of this 
variability is the metabolism of clopidogrel, which is a prodrug that 
requires absorption and biotransformation to become an active anti-
platelet compound. Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes play a role in 
the metabolism, and carriers of particular genetic variants in CYP2C19 
(30%  of  the  population)  have  lower  active  clopidogrel  metabolite 
levels,  diminished  platelet  inhibition,  and  higher  rates  of  adverse 

cardiovascular events than do noncarriers in the setting of PCI.105-107 
The response to clopidogrel may also vary as a function of a patients 
clinical characteristics, such as age or diabetic status.104

Prasugrel and ticagrelor generally achieve greater degrees of plate-
let inhibition than clopidogrel does and can be used to treat patients 
with STEMI. On the basis of the results of TRITON-TIMI 38, prasugrel 
administered  as  an  oral  loading  dose  of  60 mg  and  10 mg  daily  
thereafter  demonstrated  benefit  in  patients  with  STEMI,  but  should 
not be used in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease who 
are  at  higher  risk  for  life-threatening  bleeding.101,102  Ticagrelor  also 
reduced  cardiovascular  events  when  compared  with  clopidogrel, 
and in PLATO, ticagrelor was administered as an oral loading dose 
of  180 mg  and  90 mg  twice  daily.103,108  When  using  ticagrelor,  the 
recommended maintenance dose of aspirin is 81 mg daily.1

HOSPITALMANAGEMENT

CoronaryCareandIntermediateCareUnits
Development of the coronary care unit (CCU) has facilitated continu-
ous monitoring of cardiac rhythm by highly trained nurses with the 
skills and authority to initiate immediate treatment of arrhythmias in 
the  absence  of  physicians  and  with  the  availability  of  specialized 
equipment  (defibrillators,  pacemakers)  and  drugs.109  The  clustering 
of patients with STEMI in the CCU greatly enhanced efficient use of 
the  trained  personnel,  facilities,  and  equipment  to  improve  patient 
outcomes.109 These benefits of geographic clustering contribute to the

optimal  care  of  patients  with  STEMI,  and  in  some  hospitals,  such  
care  can  be  provided  in  intermediate  care  telemetry  units  with 
well-trained  staff  outside  the  CCU.  Such  intermediate  care  units, 
when  equipped  with  continuous  electrocardiographic  monitoring 
and  resuscitation  equipment,  may  be  appropriate  for  initial  admis-
sion of patients with a low risk for mortality from STEMI. This strategy 
has  proved  cost-effective  and  may  reduce  CCU  use  by  a  third,  
shorten  hospital  stays,  and  have  no  deleterious  effect  on  patients 
recovery.1

With increasing attention directed to limitations on resources and 
to the economic impact of intensive care, the proportion of appropri-
ately selected patients with STEMI cared for in an intermediate care 
unit is likely to increase. Nevertheless, a dedicated CCU is the envi-
ronment most often used to provide care for patients with STEMI, and 
it plays a pivotal role in the management of patients with major com-
plications of STEMI, who may require treatment of refractory arrhyth-
mias,  use  of  invasive  hemodynamic  monitoring,  or  mechanical 
circulatory support.110 Facilities in which patients can undergo diag-
nostic and therapeutic angiographic procedures are often integrated 
into the structure of a coronary care team.111 The capacity for early 
detection  of  problems  following  STEMI  and  the  social  and  educa-
tional benefits of grouping such patients together strongly argue for 
continued use of CCUs and intermediate care units with experienced 
multidisciplinary staff.

In patients with STEMI managed in a CCU, those with an uncom-
plicated  status,  such  as  patients  without  congestive  heart  failure, 
hypotension, heart block, hemodynamically compromising ventricu-
lar arrhythmias, or persistent ischemic-type discomfort, can be safely 
transferred  out  of  the  CCU  within  24  to  36  hours.  In  patients  with 
complicated STEMI, the duration of the CCU stay should be dictated 
by the need for intensive carethat is, hemodynamic monitoring, 
close  nursing  supervision,  intravenous  vasoactive  drugs,  and  fre-
quent changes in the medical regimen.

General Measures
The managing clinical staff should be sensitive to patient concerns 
about  prognosis  and  future  productivity.  A  calm,  quiet  atmosphere 
can help allay anxiety and reduce sympathetic tone, thereby poten-
tially  reducing  hypertension,  tachycardia,  and  arrhythmias.  Use  of 
anxiolytic medications may be appropriate in some cases. To reduce 
the risk for nausea and vomiting early after infarction and to decrease 
the  risk  for  aspiration,  patients  should  receive  either  nothing  
by  mouth  or  a  clear  liquid  diet  during  the  first  4  to  12  hours  after 
admission.  Thereafter,  dietary  intervention  is  an  important  compo-
nent of an overall strategy for secondary prevention (see Chapters 
42 and 46).

The  results  of  laboratory  tests  should  be  scrutinized  for  any 
derangements potentially contributing to arrhythmias, such as hypox-
emia, hypovolemia, or disturbances in acid-base balance or electro-
lytes. Delirium can be provoked by medications frequently used in 
the hospital, including antiarrhythmic drugs, H2 blockers, narcotics, 
and  beta  blockers.  Use  of  potentially  offending  agents  should  be 
discontinued in patients with an abnormal mental status. Haloperi-
dol,  a  butyrophenone,  can  be  used  safely  in  patients  with  STEMI. 
Stool  softeners  should  be  considered  to  prevent  constipation  and 
straining.

Physical Activity
In the absence of complications, stabilized patients with STEMI need 
not be confined to bed for more than 12 hours, and unless they are 
hemodynamically compromised, they may use a bedside commode 
shortly after admission. Progression of activity should be individual-
ized  depending  on  the  patients  clinical  status,  age,  and  physical 
capacity.  In  patients  without  hemodynamic  compromise,  early 
mobilizationincluding  sitting  in  a  chair,  standing,  and  walking 
around the beddoes not usually cause important changes in heart 
rate, blood pressure, or pulmonary wedge pressure. As long as the 
blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  are  monitored,  early  mobilization 
offers considerable psychological and physical benefit without any 
clear medical risk.

1115

PharmacologicTherapy
Beta Blockers
Use  of  beta  blockers  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  STEMI  can 
cause  both  immediate  effects  (when  the  drug  is  given  early  in  the 
course  of  infarction)  and  long-term  effects  (secondary  prevention). 
Immediate intravenous administration of beta blockers reduces the 
cardiac  index,  heart  rate,  and  blood  pressure.112  The  net  effect 
is  a  reduction  in  myocardial  oxygen  consumption  per  minute  and  
per  beat.  Favorable  effects  of  acute  intravenous  administration  of 
beta  blockers  on  the  balance  of  myocardial  oxygen  supply  and 
demand are reflected in reductions in chest pain, in the proportion 
of  patients  with  threatened  infarction  in  whom  STEMI  actually 
evolves, and in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Because 
beta-adrenergic  blockade  diminishes  circulating  levels  of  free  
fatty  acids  by  antagonizing  the  lipolytic  effects  of  catecholamines 
and  because  elevated  levels  of  fatty  acids  augment  myocardial 
oxygen consumption and probably increase the incidence of arrhyth-
mias,  these  metabolic  actions  of  beta  blockers  may  also  benefit  
the  ischemic  heart.  As  noted  earlier,  because  early  administration  
of  intravenous  beta  blockers  can  cause  detrimental  effects  in  
some  patients,  the  present  guidelines  omit  this  therapy  for  most 
patients.1

More than 52,000 patients have been randomly assigned to treat-
ment  in  clinical  trials  studying  beta-adrenergic  blockade  for  acute 
MI.1 These trials cover a range of beta blockers and timing of admin-
istration  and  were  largely  conducted  in  the  era  before  reperfusion 
strategies  were  developed  for  STEMI.  Data  available  in  the  pre-
reperfusion  era  suggested  favorable  trends  toward  a  reduction  in 
mortality,  reinfarction,  and  cardiac  arrest.  In  the  reperfusion  era, 
adding  an  intravenous  beta  blocker  to  fibrinolytic  therapy  was  not 
associated with a reduction in mortality but helped reduce the rate 
of recurrent ischemic events. Concern arose regarding the potential 
risk of provoking cardiogenic shock if early intravenous followed by 
oral  beta-adrenergic  blockade  was  routinely  administered  to  all 
patients with STEMI. The largest trial of beta blockade in patients with 
acute  MI  was  COMMIT,  which  randomly  assigned  45,852  patients 
within 24 hours of MI to metoprolol given as sequential intravenous 
boluses  of  5 mg  up  to  15 mg,  followed  by  200 mg/day  orally,  or  to 
placebo.1 The rate of the composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, 
or cardiac arrest in the metoprolol group (9.4%) did not differ from 
that in the placebo group (9.9%). Significant reductions occurred in 
reinfarction and episodes of VF in the metoprolol group, which trans-
lated into 5 fewer events for each of these endpoints per 1000 patients 
treated; yet there were 11 more episodes of cardiogenic shock in the 
metoprolol group per 1000 patients treated. Risk for the development 
of  cardiogenic  shock  (which  was  recorded  as  part  of  the  COMMIT 
protocol in contrast to earlier studies) was greatest in patients with 
moderate  to  severe  left  ventricular  dysfunction  (Killip  class  II  or 
greater).

The  combined  results  of  the  low-risk  patients  from  COMMIT  and 
data  from  earlier  trials  provide  an  overview  of  the  effects  of  early 
intravenous  therapy  followed  by  oral  therapy  with  beta  blockers  
(Fig. 52-19). A 13% reduction occurred in all-cause mortality (7 lives 
saved  per  1000  patients  treated),  along  with  a  22%  reduction  in  
reinfarction  (5  fewer  events  per  1000  patients  treated)  and  a  15% 
reduction in VF or cardiac arrest (5 fewer events per 1000 patients 
treated).  To  achieve  these  benefits  safely,  early  administration  of 
beta  blockers  to  patients  with  relative  contraindications  should  be 
avoided, as outlined in Table 52-7.

Recommendations
Given  the  evidence  of  a  benefit  of  early  administration  of  beta-
blocking agents for STEMI, patients without a contraindication, irre-
spective of the administration of concomitant fibrinolytic therapy or 
performance of primary PCI, should receive oral beta blockers within 
the first 24 hours (Table 52-7). Prompt intravenous administration of 
beta-blocking therapy to patients with STEMI is also reasonable if a 
tachyarrhythmia or hypertension is present, in the absence of signs 
of  heart  failure/low  output,  increased  risk  for  the  development  of

FIGURE52-19  Meta-analysis of the effects of intravenous and then oral beta blocker therapy on death, reinfarction, and cardiac arrest during the scheduled treatment 
periods in 26 small randomized trials, MIAMI, ISIS-1, and the low-risk subset of COMMIT. For COMMIT, data are included only for patients with a systolic blood pressure 
higher than 105 mm Hg, a heart rate greater than 65 beats/minute, and Killip class I (as in MIAMI7). Five small trials included in the ISIS-1 report did not have any data on 
reinfarction. In the ISIS-1 trial, data on reinfarction in the hospital were available for the last three quarters of the study and involved 11,641 patients. ORs in each (blue 
squares with the area proportional to the number of events) were determined by comparing outcomes in patients allocated to beta blocker therapy with those in patients 
allocated to control, along with 99% CIs (horizontal lines). Overall ORs and 95% CIs are plotted by the diamonds, with value and significance given alongside. (From Chen

TABLE52-7  Recommendations for Beta Blocker Therapy for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

RECOMMENDATION

COR

Oral beta blockers should be initiated in the first 24 hours in patients with STEMI who do not have any of the following:

Signs of heart failure or evidence of a low-output state
Increased risk for cardiogenic shock*:

Age > 70 years
Systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg
Sinus tachycardia >110 beats/min or heart rate <60 beats/min
Increased time since the onset of symptoms of STEMI

Other contraindications to use of oral beta blockers:

PR interval longer than 0.24 second
Second- or third-degree heart block
Active asthma or reactive airways disease

Beta blockers should be continued during and after hospitalization for all patients with STEMI and no contraindications 

to their use.

Patients with initial contraindications to the use of beta blockers in the first 24 hours after STEMI should be reevaluated 

to determine their subsequent eligibility.

shock, indicators of high risk for the development of shock, or other 
relative contraindications to beta blockers.1

Beta blockers are especially helpful in STEMI patients with signifi-
cant residual unrevascularized CAD and evidence of recurrent isch-
emia  or  tachyarrhythmias  early  after  the  onset  of  infarction.113  If 
adverse effects of beta blockers develop or if patients have complica-
tions of infarction that are contraindications to beta blockade, such 
as  heart  failure  or  heart  block,  beta  blockers  should  be  withheld. 
Unless there are contraindications (Table 52-7), beta blockade prob-
ably should be continued in patients in whom STEMI develops. More-
over, patients who initially have contraindications to a beta blocker, 
such  as  heart  failure,  should  be  reevaluated  with  respect  to  their 
candidacy for such therapy after 24 hours.1

Selection of Beta Blockers
Favorable  effects  have  been  reported  with  metoprolol,  atenolol, 
carvedilol,  timolol,  and  alprenolol;  these  benefits  probably  occur 
with  propranolol  and  with  esmolol,  an  ultrashort-acting  agent,  as 
well. In the absence of any favorable evidence supporting the benefit 
of agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, such as pindolol 
and oxprenolol, and with some unfavorable evidence for these agents 
in  secondary  prevention,  beta  blockers  with  intrinsic  sympathomi-
metic  activity  should  probably  not  be  chosen  for  treatment  of  
STEMI. The CAPRICORN (CArvedilol Post infaRction survIval COntRol 
in left ventricular dysfunctioN) trial randomly assigned 1959 patients 
with  MI  and  systolic  dysfunction  (ejection  fraction <40%)  to  carve-
dilol  or  placebo  in  addition  to  contemporary  pharmacotherapy, 
including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in 98% of 
patients. All-cause mortality was reduced over a mean follow-up of 
1.3 years by 23% with carvedilol in comparison to placebo (P = 0.031), 
with a similar pattern noted during the first 30 days.114 Thus CAPRI-
CORN confirmed the benefit of administration of a beta blocker in 
addition  to  ACE  inhibitor  therapy  in  patients  with  transient  or  sus-
tained left ventricular dysfunction after MI.

Occasionally, clinicians may wish to proceed with therapy with a 
beta blocker even in patients with relative contraindications, such as 
a history of mild asthma, mild bradycardia, mild heart failure, or first-
degree heart block. In this situation a trial of esmolol may help deter-
mine  whether  the  patient  can  tolerate  beta-adrenergic  blockade. 
Because the hemodynamic effects of this drug, which has a half-life 
of 9 minutes, disappear in less than 30 minutes, it offers an advantage 
over  longer-acting  agents  when  the  risk  for  complications  with  a 
beta blocker is relatively high.

Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
The  rationale  for  inhibition  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system  (RAAS)  includes  experimental  and  clinical  evidence  of  a 
favorable impact on ventricular remodeling, improvement in hemo-
dynamics,  and  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  congestive  heart 
failure. Unequivocal evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials  has  shown  that  ACE  inhibitors  reduce  the  rate  of  mortality  
from  STEMI.1  These  trials  can  be  grouped  into  two  categories.  The 
first  group  selected  MI  patients  for  randomization  on  the  basis  of 
features  indicative  of  increased  mortality,  such  as  left  ventricular 
ejection  fraction  lower  than  40%,  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of 
congestive heart failure, anterior location of infarction, and abnormal 
wall  motion  score  index  (Fig.  52-20).  The  second  group  consisted 
of  unselective  trials  that  randomized  all  patients  with  MI  provided 
that  they  had  a  minimum  systolic  pressure  of  approximately 
100 mm Hg  (ISIS-4,  GISSI-3  [Gruppo  Italiano  per  lo  Studio  della 
Sopravvivenza nellinfarto Miocardico], CONSENSUS II [Cooperative 
New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II], and the Chinese Cap-
topril Study) (Fig. 52-21). With the exception of the SMILE (Survival 
of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation) study, all the selec-
tive trials initiated ACE inhibitor therapy between 3 and 16 days after 
MI and maintained it for 1 to 4 years, whereas the unselective trials 
all initiated treatment within the first 24 to 36 hours and maintained 
it for only 4 to 6 weeks.

A consistent survival benefit was observed in all the trials already 
noted,  except  for  CONSENSUS  II,  the  one  study  that  used  an

intravenous preparation early in the course of MI. An estimate of the 
mortality  benefit  of  ACE  inhibitors  in  the  unselective  trials  with  a 
short duration of therapy was 5 lives saved per 1000 patients treated. 
Analysis of these unselective short-term trials indicates that approxi-
mately a third of the lives saved occurred within the first 1 to 2 days. 
Certain subgroups, such as patients with anterior infarction, showed 
proportionately greater benefit with the early administration (11 lives 
saved per 1000) of ACE inhibitors. Not unexpectedly, greater survival 
benefits of 42 to 76 lives saved per 1000 patients treated were obtained 
in the selective trials with a long duration oftherapy. Of note, a general 
20% reduction in the risk for death attributable to ACE inhibitor treat-
ment occurred in the selective trials. The reduction in mortality with 
ACE  inhibitors  was  accompanied  by  significant  reductions  in  the 
development of heart failure, thus supporting the underlying patho-
physiologic rationale for administering this class of drugs to patients 
with STEMI. In addition, some data suggest that chronic administra-
tion of ACE inhibitors after STEMI reduces the incidence of ischemic 
events,  including  recurrent  infarction  and  the  need  for  coronary 
revascularization.29

The  mortality  benefits  of  ACE  inhibitors  are  additive  to  those 
achieved with aspirin and beta blockers. The benefits of ACE inhibi-
tion appear to be a class effect inasmuch as several agents have been 
associated with reduced mortality and morbidity. To replicate these 
benefits in clinical practice, however, physicians should select a spe-
cific agent and prescribe the drug according to the protocols used in 
the successful clinical trials reported to date.115

The major contraindications to the use of ACE inhibitors in patients 
with STEMI include hypotension in the setting of adequate preload, 
known  hypersensitivity,  and  pregnancy.  Adverse  reactions  include 
hypotension,  especially  after  the  first  dose,  and  intolerable  cough; 
much less commonly, angioedema can occur.

An alternative method of pharmacologic inhibition of the RAAS is 
the administration of angiotensin II receptorblocking agents (ARBs). 
The VALIANT (VALsartan In Acute myocardial infarction) trial com-
pared the effects of the ARB valsartan, valsartan and captopril, and 
captopril  alone  on  mortality  in  patients  with  acute  MI  complicated 
by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and/or heart failure within 10 
days  of  MI.29  Rates  of  mortality  were  similar  in  the  three  treatment 
groups: 19.9% with valsartan, 19.3% with valsartan plus captopril, and 
19.5% with captopril alone.

Aldosterone blockade is another pharmacologic strategy for inhibi-
tion of the RAAS. The EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure 
Efficacy  and  Survival)  trial  randomly  assigned  6642  patients  with 
acute MI complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure 
to the selective aldosterone-blocking agent eplerenone or placebo in 
conjunction with contemporary postinfarction pharmacotherapy.116,117 
During  a  mean  follow-up  period  of  16  months,  a  15%  reduction 
occurred in the RR for mortality in favor of eplerenone (Fig. 52-22). 
Eplerenone also reduced cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization 
for  cardiovascular  events.  Serious  hyperkalemia  (serum  potassium 
concentration,  6  mmol/liter)  occurred  in  5.5%  of  patients  in  the 
eplerenone  group  as  compared  with  3.9%  in  the  placebo  group 
(P = 0.002).

Recommendations
After administration of aspirin and initiation of reperfusion strategies 
and, when appropriate, beta blockers, all patients with STEMI should 
be considered for inhibition of the RAAS. Although few disagree with 
the recommendation that high-risk STEMI patients (elderly, anterior 
infarction, previous infarction, Killip class II or greater, and asymp-
tomatic patients with evidence of depressed global ventricular func-
tion on an imaging study) should receive life-long treatment with ACE 
inhibitors, some have proposed short-term (4 to 6 weeks) therapy for 
a broader group of patients on the basis of the pooled results of the 
unselective mortality trials.1,115

Considering all the data available, we favor a strategy of an initial 
trial of oral ACE inhibitors in all patients with STEMI and congestive 
heart  failure,  as  well  as  in  hemodynamically  stable  patients  with 
ST-segment  elevation  or  left  bundle  branch  block,  commencing 
within the first 24 hours. ACE inhibition therapy should be continued 
indefinitely  in  patients  with  congestive  heart  failure,  evidence  of  a 
reduction in global function, or a large regional wall motion abnor-
mality.  In  patients  without  these  findings,  long-term  treatment  with 
ACE inhibitors is based on other considerations related to the poten-
tial benefits on secondary prevention (see Chapter 42). ARBs are a

clinically effective alternative to ACE inhibitors. The choice between 
ACE  inhibition  and  an  ARB  following  STEMI  should  be  based  on 
physician  experience  with  the  agents,  patient  tolerability,  safety,  
convenience,  and  cost.  Finally,  long-term  aldosterone  blockade 
should  be  instituted  in  high-risk  patients  following  STEMI  (ejection 
fraction  <40%,  clinical  heart  failure,  diabetes  mellitus)  who  are 
already receiving an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and do not have 
contraindications. Given the small but definite increase in the risk for 
serious  hyperkalemia  when  aldosterone  blockade  is  prescribed,  
particularly when other measures for RAAS inhibition are used con-
currently, periodic monitoring of the serum potassium level should 
be undertaken.117

Nitrates
The  potential  for  reductions  in  ventricular  filling  pressure,  wall 
tension,  and  cardiac  work,  coupled  with  improvement  in  coronary 
blood  flow,  especially  in  ischemic  zones,  and  antiplatelet  effects, 
makes nitrates a logical and attractive pharmacologic intervention in 
patients with STEMI.1 Administration of nitrates reduces pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure and systemic arterial pressure, left ventricu-
lar  chamber  volume,  infarct  size,  and  the  incidence  of  mechanical 
complications. Nevertheless, routine administration of nitrates does 
not alter survival in patients with STEMI.

Although a meta-analysis of 10 trials conducted in the prefibrino-
lytic era showed nitrate therapy to be associated with a reduction in 
mortality,82 two megatrials of nitrate therapy conducted in the reper-
fusion  era  demonstrated  no  benefit  on  major  cardiovascular  out-
comes.1  In  GISSI-3  and  ISIS-4,  no  independent  effect  of  nitrates  on 
short-term mortality was detected.

Intravenous  nitroglycerin  can  be  administered  safely  to  patients 
with evolving STEMI as long as the dose is titrated to avoid induction 
of reflex tachycardia or systemic arterial hypotension. Patients with 
inferior wall infarction may be sensitive to an excessive fall in preload, 
particularly  with  concurrent  right  ventricular  infarction.1  In  such 
cases, nitrate-induced venodilation could impair cardiac output and 
reduce coronary blood flow, thus worsening rather than improving 
myocardial oxygenation.

Clinically  significant  methemoglobinemia,  although  rare,  can 
develop when unusually large doses of nitrates are administered. This 
problem is important not only for its potential to cause symptoms of 
lethargy  and  headache  but  also  because  elevated  methemoglobin 
levels can impair the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and poten-
tially  exacerbate  ischemia.  Dilation  of  the  pulmonary  vasculature 
supplying poorly ventilated lung segments may produce a ventilation-
perfusion mismatch. Tolerance to intravenous nitroglycerin (as mani-
fested by increasing nitrate requirements) develops in many patients, 
often as soon as 12 hours after the infusion is started.

Recommendations
Nitroglycerin  is  indicated  for  the  relief  of  persistent  pain  and  as  a 
vasodilator in patients with infarction associated with left ventricular 
failure or hypertension. In the absence of recurrent angina or heart 
failure, we do not routinely prescribe nitrates for patients with STEMI. 
Long-term  nitrates  have  no  clear  benefit  in  asymptomatic  patients, 
and we therefore do not prescribe them beyond the first 48 hours in 
patients without angina or ventricular failure.

Calcium Channel Antagonists
Despite sound experimental and clinical evidence of an anti-ischemic 
effect, calcium antagonists have not been helpful in the acute phase 
of  STEMI,  and  several  systematic  overviews  have  raised  concern 
about an increased risk for mortality when these agentsand par-
ticularly short-acting dihydropyridinesare prescribed on a routine 
basis.  Nondihydropyridine  calcium  channelblocking  agents  (vera-
pamil and diltiazem) can be given to slow a rapid ventricular response 
in atrial fibrillation in patients for whom beta blockers are ineffective. 
They  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with  Killip  class  II  or  greater 
hemodynamic findings.

Other Therapies
Magnesium
A functional deficit in available magnesium may develop in patients 
with STEMI. Because of the risk for cardiac arrhythmias when elec-
trolyte deficits are present in the early phase of infarction, patients 
with STEMI should have their serum magnesium measured on admis-
sion. We advocate repleting magnesium deficits to maintain a serum 
magnesium level of 2 mEq/liter or greater. In the presence of hypo-
kalemia,  the  serum  magnesium  level  should  be  rechecked  and 
repleted if necessary because it is often difficult to correct a potas-
sium deficit in the presence of a concurrent magnesium deficit. There 
is no indication for routine intravenous administration of magnesium 
to patients with STEMI.

Glucose Control During ST-Elevation Myocardial 
Infarction (See also Chapter 61)
During the acute phase of STEMI, catecholamine levels increase in 
both the blood and ischemic myocardium. Insulin levels remain low, 
whereas cortisol, glucagon, and free fatty acid levels increase. These 
factors  may  contribute  to  an  elevation  in  the  blood  glucose  level, 
which should be measured routinely on admission. Intensive insulin 
therapy to strictly control blood glucose is no longer recommended 
routinely for patients with MI.118 Blood glucose levels should be main-
tained below 180 mg/dL if possible while avoiding hypoglycemia.1

Routine  administration  of  infusions  of  glucose-insulin-potassium 
(GIK)  to  patients  with  STEMI  was  proposed  to  reduce  mortality.  A 
series of small trials suggested that GIK infusions were beneficial, but 
the  CREATE-ECLA  (Clinical  Trial  of  MEtabolic  Modulation  in  Acute 
Myocardial  Infarction  Treatment  Evaluation-Estudios  Cardiologicos 
Latinoamerica) investigators randomly assigned 20,201 patients with 
STEMI (83% of whom received reperfusion therapy) to GIK or placebo 
and found no impact on mortality (30-day mortality, 9.7% in control 
patients and 10% in GIK patients).119,120 In addition, prehospital admin-
istration of GIK did not improve the primary endpoint of progression 
to MI in patients with ACSs.121 Thus in the contemporary era of man-
agement  of  STEMI  in  which  other  effective  therapies  (reperfusion, 
aspirin, ACE inhibitors) are administered, routine use of GIK infusions 
appears to have no benefit.

Other Agents
Multiple  adjunctive  pharmacotherapies  to  prevent  inflammatory 
damage  in  the  infarct  zone  have  been  investigated  but  have  not 
shown  clinical  benefit.122  For  example,  pexelizumab,  a  monoclonal 
antibody against the C5 component of complement, had no effect on 
infarct size in patients with STEMI treated with either fibrinolytics or 
PCI or on mortality in patients treated with primary PCI.123 Intravenous 
administration of adenosine to reduce myocardial injury in patients 
with STEMI has been studied. Although administration of high-dose 
adenosine  has  been  associated  with  a  reduction  in  infarct  size, 
neither  high-dose  nor  low-dose  adenosine  improves  clinical  out-
comes such as death or the development of heart failure when com-
pared with placebo.124

HEMODYNAMICDISTURBANCES

HemodynamicAssessment
Patients with clinically uncomplicated STEMI do not require invasive 
hemodynamic monitoring because clinical evaluation can be used 
to assess the status of the circulation. Routine assessments in patients 
with STEMI should include monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm, 
repeated measurement of systemic arterial pressure by cuff, repeated 
auscultation  of  the  lung  fields  for  pulmonary  congestion,  measure-
ment  of  urine  output,  examination  of  the  skin  for  evidence  of  the 
adequacy of perfusion, and monitoring for hypoxemia.

In  patients  with  STEMI  who have  clinical signs  and symptoms  of 
heart failure, assessment of the degree of hemodynamic compromise 
is  important.  Central  venous  pressure  reflects  right  rather  than  left 

1119

ventricular  function.  Right  ventricular  functionand  therefore  sys-
temic venous pressuremay be normal or almost so in patients with 
significant left ventricular failure. Conversely, patients with right ven-
tricular  failure  caused  by  right  ventricular  infarction  or  pulmonary 
embolism may exhibit elevated right atrial and central venous pres-
sure  despite  normal  left  ventricular  function.  Low  values  for  right 
atrial and central venous pressure imply hypovolemia, whereas ele-
vated right atrial pressure usually results from right ventricular failure 
secondary  to  left  ventricular  failure,  pulmonary  hypertension,  right 
ventricular  infarction,  or  less  commonly,  tricuspid  regurgitation  or 
pericardial tamponade.

In  patients  with  complicated  STEMI  it  may  be  useful  to  establish 
invasive monitoring with an intra-arterial catheter and a pulmonary 
artery  catheter  for  measurement  of  pulmonary  artery,  pulmonary 
artery  occlusive  (equivalent  to  pulmonary  wedge),  and  right  atrial 
pressure, as well as cardiac output. In patients with hypotension, a 
Foley  catheter  provides  accurate  and  continuous  measurement  of 
urine output.

Monitoring of Pulmonary Artery Pressure
Table 52-8 describes circumstances when to consider invasive moni-
toring. Patients most likely to benefit from pulmonary artery catheter 
monitoring include those whose STEMI is complicated by (1) hypo-
tension that is not easily corrected by fluid administration, (2) hypo-
tension in the presence of congestive heart failure, (3) hemodynamic 
compromise  severe  enough  to  require  intravenous  vasopressors  or 
vasodilators or intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, (4) mechanical 
lesions (or suspected ones) such as severe mitral regurgitation and a 
ruptured  ventricular  septum,  and  (5)  right  ventricular  infarction.125 
Other  possible  indications  for  hemodynamic  monitoring  include 
assessment  of  the  effects  of  mechanical  ventilation,  differentiating 
pulmonary disease from left ventricular failure as the cause of hypox-
emia, and management of septic shock (Table 52-8).

Before  inserting  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  into  a  patient  with 
STEMI,  the  physician  must  believe  that  the  potential  benefit  of  the 
information that can obtained outweighs any potential risks. Accu-
mulating evidence from settings other than STEMI suggests that inva-
sive hemodynamic monitoring does not improve outcomes.126 Major 
complications from pulmonary artery catheters are not common, but 
severe problems can occurincluding sepsis, pulmonary infarction, 
and pulmonary artery rupture. Minimized duration of catheterization 
and strict adherence to aseptic technique can diminish the risk. Using 
antiseptic-impregnated  dressings  can  also  reduce  catheter-related 
bloodstream infections.127 Noninvasive methods of determination of 
cardiac output, such as pulse contour analysis and thoracic electrical 
bioimpedance, are also available.128,129

Accurate determination of hemodynamics by clinical assessment 
can  be  difficult  in  critically  ill  patients.  Use  of  a  pulmonary  artery 
catheter thus often leads to important changes in therapy. Of note, 
some reports have shown that complication and mortality rates may 
be higher in patients who undergo pulmonary artery catheterization, 
although such patients are often at higher risk initially. These obser-
vations  emphasize  the  importance  of  patient  selection,  meticulous 
technique, and correct interpretation of the data obtained.129

Hemodynamic Abnormalities
In 1976, Swan, Forrester, and associates measured cardiac output and

proposed earlier by Killip and Kimball (Table 52-9), has proved quite 
useful, but it should be noted that patients frequently pass from one 
category  to  another  with  therapy  and  sometimes  apparently  even 
spontaneously.

Hemodynamic Subsets
A patients clinical status typically reflects these subsets. Hypoperfu-
sion usually becomes evident clinically when the cardiac index falls 
below approximately 2.2 liters/min/m2, whereas pulmonary conges-
tion  is  noted  when  the  wedge  pressure  exceeds  approximately 
18 mm Hg.  However,  approximately  25%  of  patients  with  cardiac 
indices lower than 2.2 liters/min/m2 and 15% of patients with elevated 
pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure  are  not  recognized  clinically. 
Discrepancies  in  the  hemodynamic  and  clinical  classification  of 
patients with STEMI arise for a variety of reasons. Patients may exhibit 
phase lags as clinical pulmonary congestion develops or resolves, 
symptoms secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may 
be  confused  with  those  resulting  from  pulmonary  congestion,  or 
longstanding left ventricular dysfunction may mask signs of hypoper-
fusion because of compensatory vasoconstriction.

The hemodynamic findings shown in Tables 52-9 and 52-10 allow 
rational approaches to therapy. The goals of hemodynamic therapy 
include  maintenance  of  ventricular  performance,  blood  pressure 
support, and protection of jeopardized myocardium. Because these 
goals  may  occasionally  be  at  cross-purposes,  recognition  of  the 
hemodynamic  profile,  as  assessed  clinically  or  as  available  from 
hemodynamic  monitoring,  may  be  needed  to  design  an  optimal 
therapeutic management strategy.

Hypotension in the Prehospital Phase
Hypotension  associated  with  bradycardia  often  reflects  excessive 
vagotonia.  Relative  or  absolute  hypovolemia  is  often  present  when 
hypotension  occurs  with  a  normal  or  rapid  heart  rate.  Marked  dia-
phoresis,  reduction  of  fluid  intake,  or  vomiting  during  the  period 
preceding and accompanying the onset of STEMI may all contribute 
to  the  development  of  hypovolemia.  Even  if  the  effective  vascular 
volume  is  normal,  relative  hypovolemia  may  be  present  because 
ventricular compliance is reduced in cases of STEMI, and a left ven-
tricular  filling  pressure  as  high  as  20 mm Hg  may  be  necessary  to 
provide optimal preload.

MANAGEMENT.  In the absence of heart failure and the presence 
of  hypotension  suspected  of  being  due  to  excessive  vagotonia, 
patients should be placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position, and 
in patients with sinus bradycardia and hypotension, atropine should 
be  administered  (0.3  to  0.6 mg  intravenously,  repeated  at  3-  to 
10-minute  intervals  up  to  2 mg).  If  these  measures  do  not  correct  
the  hypotension,  normal  saline  should  be  administered  intrave-
nously  (e.g.,  beginning  with  a  bolus  of  100 mL,  followed  by  50-mL 
increments  every  5  minutes)  while  monitoring  for  signs  of  heart

failure.  Because  of  the  poor  correlation  between  left  ventricular 
filling  pressure  and  mean  right  atrial  pressure,  assessment  of  sys-
temic  (even  central)  venous  pressure  can  be  of  limited  value  as  a 
guide to fluid therapy. Administration of positive inotropic agents is 
indicated during the prehospital phase if systemic hypotension per-
sists despite correction of hypovolemia.

The Hyperdynamic State
When infarction is not complicated by hemodynamic impairment, no 
therapy  other  than  general  supportive  measures  and  treatment  of 
arrhythmias  is  necessary.  However,  if  the  hemodynamic  profile 
involves  a  hyperdynamic  statethat  is,  elevation  of  the  sinus  rate, 
arterial pressure, and cardiac index, occurring singly or together in 
the presence of a normal or low left ventricular filling pressureand 
if  infection  and  other  causes  of  tachycardia  such  as  fever  can  be 
excluded,  treatment  with  beta  blockers  is  indicated.  Presumably,  
the increased heart rate and blood pressure result from inappropriate 
activation  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  possibly  because  
of  augmented  release  of  catecholamines  triggered  by  pain  and/ 
or anxiety.

LeftVentricularFailure
Left ventricular dysfunction is the single most important predictor of 
mortality following STEMI (Fig. 52-23).130-133 In patients with STEMI, 
either  systolic  dysfunction  alone  or  both  systolic  and  diastolic  dys-
function  can  occur.  Left  ventricular  diastolic  dysfunction  leads  to 
pulmonary venous hypertension and pulmonary congestion. Clinical 
manifestations  of  left  ventricular  failure  become  more  common  as 
the extent of injury to the left ventricle increases. In addition to infarct 
size, other important predictors of the development of symptomatic 
left ventricular dysfunction include advanced age and diabetes.132,134 
Mortality  increases  in  association  with  the  severity  of  the  hemody-
namic deficit.

Therapeutic Implications
Classification  of  patients  with  STEMI  by  hemodynamic  subsets  has 
therapeutic relevance. As already noted, patients with normal wedge 
pressure  and  hypoperfusion  may  benefit  from  infusion  of  fluids 
because  the  peak  stroke  volume  value  is  not  usually  attained  until 
left ventricular filling pressure reaches 18 to 24 mm Hg. However, a 
low level of left ventricular filling pressure does not necessarily imply 
that the left ventricular damage is slight. Such patients may be rela-
tively  hypovolemic  and/or  may  have  suffered  a  right  ventricular 
infarct with or without severe left ventricular damage.

The relationship between ventricular filling pressure and cardiac 
index  when  preload  is  increased  by  infusion  of  fluid  can  provide 
valuable hemodynamic information in addition to that obtained from

baseline measurements. For example, the ventricular function curve 
rises  steeply  (marked  increase  in  cardiac  index,  small  increase  in 
filling pressure) in patients with normal left ventricular function and 
hypovolemia,  whereas  the  curve  rises  gradually  or  remains  flat  in 
patients with a combination of hypovolemia and depressed cardiac 
function. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring can help guide therapy 
in  patients  with  severe  left  ventricular  failure  (pulmonary  capillary 
wedge  pressure  >18 mm Hg  and  cardiac  index  <2.2  liters/min/m2). 
Although positive inotropic agents can be useful, they do not repre-
sent  the  initial  therapy  of  choice  for  patients  with  STEMI.  Instead, 
heart failure is managed most effectively first by reducing ventricular 
preload and then, if possible, by lowering afterload. Arrhythmias can 
contribute  to  hemodynamic  compromise  and  should  be  treated 
promptly in patients with left ventricular failure.

Hypoxemia
In STEMI complicated by heart failure, hypoxemia caused by a com-
bination  of  pulmonary  vascular  engorgement  (and  in  some  cases, 
pulmonary interstitial edema), diminished vital capacity, and in some 
patients,  contributory  respiratory  depression  from  narcotic  analge-
sics characteristically develops. Hypoxemia can impair the function 
of ischemic tissue at the margin of the infarct and thereby contribute 
to establishing or perpetuating the vicious cycle (see Chapter 51). 
The ventilation-perfusion mismatch that results in hypoxemia requires 
careful  attention  to  ventilatory  support.  Increasing  fractions  of 
inspired  oxygen  (FIO2)  via  facemask  should  be  used  initially,  but  if 
oxygen saturation cannot be maintained above 85% to 90% with 100% 
FIO2, strong consideration should be given to endotracheal intubation 
and  positive-pressure  ventilation.  The  improvement  in  arterial  oxy-
genation and hence myocardial oxygen supply may help restore ven-
tricular performance. Positive end-expiratory pressure may diminish 
systemic  venous  return  and  reduce  effective  left  ventricular  filling 
pressure.  This  effect  may  require  reducing  the  amount  of  positive 
end-expiratory pressure, normal saline infusions to maintain left ven-
tricular filling pressure, adjustment of the rate of infusion of vasodila-
tors  such  as  nitroglycerin,  or  some  combination  of  these  factors. 
Because myocardial ischemia frequently occurs during the return to 
unsupported  spontaneous  breathing,  weaning  should  be  accompa-
nied  by  observation  for  signs  of  ischemia  and  may  benefit  from  a 
period of supported ventilation before extubation in patients who are 
not already revascularized.

Diuretics
Mild heart failure in patients with STEMI frequently responds well to 
diuretics such as furosemide administered intravenously in doses of 
10 mg to 40 mg, repeated at 3- to 4-hour intervals if necessary. The 
resultant decrease in pulmonary capillary pressure reduces dyspnea, 
and the lowering of left ventricular wall tension that accompanies the 
reduction in left ventricular diastolic volume diminishes myocardial 
oxygen requirements and may lead to improvement in contractility 
and augmentation of the ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac 
output. The reduction in elevated left ventricular filling pressure may 
also enhance myocardial oxygen delivery by diminishing the imped-
ance  to  coronary  perfusion  attributable  to  the  elevated  ventricular 
wall  tension.  It  may  also  improve  arterial  oxygenation  by  reducing 
pulmonary vascular congestion.

Intravenous administration of furosemide reduces pulmonary vas-
cular congestion and pulmonary venous pressure within 15 minutes, 
before  renal  excretion  of  sodium  and  water  has  occurred;  presum-
ably  this  action  results  from  a  direct  dilating  effect  of  this  drug  
on  the  systemic  arterial  bed.  Left  ventricular  filling  pressure  
should not be reduced much below 18 mm Hg, the lower range being 
associated  with  optimal  left  ventricular  performance  in  patients  
with  STEMI,  because  this  may  reduce  cardiac  output  further  and 
cause  arterial  hypotension.  Excessive  diuresis  may  also  result  in 
hypokalemia.

Afterload Reduction
Myocardial  oxygen  requirements  depend  on  left  ventricular  wall 
stress,  which  in  turn  is  proportional  to  the  product  of  the

peak developed left ventricular pressure, volume, and wall thickness. 
Intravenous  vasodilator  therapy  should  be  considered  in  patients 
with  STEMI  complicated  by  (1)  heart  failure  unresponsive  to  treat-
ment with diuretics, (2) hypertension, (3) mitral regurgitation, or (4) 
ventricular septal defect. In these patients, treatment with vasodilator 
agents increases stroke volume and may reduce myocardial oxygen 
requirements and thereby lessen ischemia. Hemodynamic monitor-
ing  of  systemic  arterial  and,  in  many  cases,  pulmonary  capillary 
wedge (or at least pulmonary artery) pressure and cardiac output in 
patients  treated  with  these  agents  is  generally  indicated.  Improve-
ment in cardiac performance and energetics requires three simulta-
neous effects: (1) reduction of left ventricular afterload, (2) avoidance 
of excessive systemic arterial hypotension to maintain effective coro-
nary perfusion pressure, and (3) avoidance of excessive reduction of 
ventricular  filling  pressure  with  consequent  diminution  of  cardiac 
output.  In  general,  pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure  should  be 
maintained at approximately 18 mm Hg and arterial pressure higher 
than  90/60 mm Hg  in  patients  who  were  normotensive  before  the 
development of STEMI.

Vasodilator  therapy  is  particularly  useful  when  STEMI  is  compli-
cated by mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum. In 
such patients, vasodilators alone or in combination with intra-aortic 
balloon counterpulsation can sometimes serve as a holding maneu-
ver  and  provide  sufficient  hemodynamic  stabilization  to  permit 
definitive  catheterization  and  angiographic  studies,  as  well  as  to 
prepare the patient for early intervention. Because of the precarious 
state of patients with complicated infarction and the need for meticu-
lous adjustment of dosage, therapy is best initiated with agents that 
can  be  administered  intravenously  and  have  a  short  duration  of 
action,  such  as  nitroprusside  or  nitroglycerin.  After  initial  stabiliza-
tion, the medication of choice is generally an ACE inhibitor, but long-
acting nitrates given by mouth can also be useful.

Nitroglycerin
This  drug  has  been  shown  in  animal  experiments  to  be  less  likely 
than  nitroprusside  to  produce  coronary  steal  (i.e.,  diversion  of 
blood  flow  from  the  ischemic  to  the  nonischemic  zone).  Therefore 
apart  from  consideration  of  its  routine  use  in  STEMI  patients  dis-
cussed earlier, it may be a particularly useful vasodilator in patients 
with STEMI complicated by left ventricular failure. A dosage of 10 to 
15 mg/min is infused, and the dose is increased by 10 mg/min every 
5 minutes until the desired effect (improvement in hemodynamics or 
relief of ischemic chest pain) is achieved or a decline in systolic arte-
rial pressure to 90 mm Hg or by more than 15 mm Hg has occurred. 
Although both nitroglycerin and nitroprusside lower systemic arterial 
pressure,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  the  heart  ratesystolic 
blood pressure product, the reduction in left ventricular filling pres-
sure  is  more  prominent  with  nitroglycerin  because  of  its  relatively 
greater effect than nitroprusside on venous capacitance vessels. Nev-
ertheless,  in  patients  with  severe  left  ventricular  failure,  cardiac 
output often increases despite the reduction in left ventricular filling 
pressure produced by nitroglycerin.

Oral Vasodilators
The use of oral vasodilators for the treatment of chronic congestive 
heart  failure  is  discussed  in  Chapter  25.  Patients  with  STEMI  and 
persistent  heart  failure  should  receive  long-term  RAAS  inhibition.1 
The reduced ventricular load decreases the left ventricle remodeling 
that occurs commonly in the period after STEMI and thereby reduces 
the development of heart failure and risk for death.135,136

Digitalis (See Chapter 25)
Although digitalis increases the contractility and oxygen consump-
tion of normal hearts, when heart failure is present, the diminution 
in heart size and wall tension frequently results in a net reduction of 
myocardial oxygen requirements. In animals, it fails to improve ven-
tricular  performance  immediately  following  experimental  coronary 
occlusion,  but  salutary  effects  are  elicited  when  it  is  administered 
several  days  later.  The  absence  of  early  beneficial  effects  may  be 
caused by the inability of ischemic tissue to respond to digitalis or 

the already maximal stimulation of contractility of the normal heart 
by circulating and neuronally released catecholamines.

Although the issue is still controversial, the incidence of arrhyth-
mias can be increased by digitalis glycosides when they are given to 
patients in the first few hours after the onset of STEMI, particularly in 
the presence of hypokalemia. Undesirable peripheral systemic and 
coronary vasoconstriction can also result from the rapid intravenous 
administration of rapidly acting glycosides such as ouabain.

Administration  of  digitalis  to  patients  with  STEMI  in  the  hospital 
phase should generally be reserved for the management of supraven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, in the 
setting  of  poor  left  ventricular  function  and  heart  failure  persisting 
despite treatment with diuretics or vasodilators. There is no indica-
tion for the use of digitalis as an inotropic agent in patients without 
clinical evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, and it is too weak an 
inotropic agent to be relied on as the principal cardiac stimulant in 
patients with overt pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

Beta-Adrenergic Agonists
When  left  ventricular  failure  is  severe,  as  manifested  by  marked  a 
reduction in the cardiac index (<2.2 liters/min/m2), and pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure is at optimal (18 to 24 mm Hg) or excessive 
(>24 mm Hg)  levels  despite  therapy  with  diuretics,  beta-adrenergic 
agonists are indicated.137 Dopamine and dobutamine can be useful 
in  patients  with  STEMI  and  reduced  cardiac  output,  increased  left 
ventricular  filling  pressure,  pulmonary  vascular  congestion,  and 
hypotension. Fortunately, the potentially deleterious alpha-adrenergic 
vasoconstrictor  effects  exerted  by  dopamine  occur  only  at  higher 
doses than those required to increase contractility. The vasodilating 
actions of dopamine on renal and splanchnic vessels and its positive 
inotropic  effects  generally  improve  hemodynamics  and  renal  func-
tion.  In  patients  with  STEMI  and  severe  left  ventricular  failure,  this 
drug  may  be  started  at  a  dose  of  3 mg/kg/min  and  be  increased 
stepwise to 20 mg/kg/min to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pres-
sure  to  approximately  18 mm Hg  and  elevate  the  cardiac  index  to 
exceed 2 liters/min/m2.

Dobutamine has a positive inotropic action comparable to that of 
dopamine  but  a  slightly  less  positive  chronotropic  effect  and  less 
vasoconstrictor activity.137 It can be administered at a starting dose of 
2 mg/kg/min and be increased stepwise to a maximum of 30 mg/kg/
min.  Both  dopamine  and  dobutamine  must  be  given  carefully  and 
with constant monitoring of the ECG, systemic arterial pressure, and 
pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery occlusive pressure and, if pos-
sible, with frequent measurements of cardiac output. The dose should 
be reduced if significant tachycardia develops, if supraventricular or 
ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  occur,  or  if  ST-segment  deviations 
increase.

Norepinephrine 

increases  myocardial  oxygen  consumption 
because  of  its  peripheral  vasoconstrictor  and  positive  inotropic 
actions and thus had previously been thought best not to be used in 
patients with MI and shock.137 However, a randomized trial that com-
pared norepinephrine with dopamine showed efficacy similar to or 
better  than  that  of  dopamine,  with  fewer  adverse  effects.138  Use  of 
norepinephrine  in  patients  with  cardiogenic  shock  has  therefore 
increased.

Although isoproterenol is a potent cardiac stimulant that improves 
ventricular performance, it should be avoided in patients with STEMI. 
It  also  causes  tachycardia  and  augments  myocardial  oxygen  con-
sumption  and  lactate  production;  in  addition,  it  reduces  coronary 
perfusion pressure by causing systemic vasodilation, and in animals 
it increases the extent of experimentally induced infarction.

Other Positive Inotropic Agents
Milrinone is a noncatecholamine, nonglycoside, phosphodiesterase 
inhibitor  with  inotropic  and  vasodilating  actions.137  It  is  useful  in 
selected patients whose heart failure persists despite treatment with 
diuretics, who are not hypotensive, and who are likely to benefit from 
both an enhancement in contractility and afterload reduction. Milri-
none should be given as a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg/min adminis-
tered over a 10-minute period, followed by a maintenance infusion of

0.375 to 0.75 mg/kg/min. The loading dose may be reduced or omitted 
if the patient has borderline hypotension.

CardiogenicShock
Cardiogenic shock is the most severe clinical expression of left ven-
tricular  failure  and  is  associated  with  extensive  damage  to  the  left 
ventricular myocardium in more than 80% of STEMI patients in whom 
it occurs; the remainder have a mechanical defect such as ventricular 
septal or papillary muscle rupture or predominant right ventricular 
infarction.130,132 This low-output state is characterized by elevated ven-
tricular  filling  pressure,  low  cardiac  output,  systemic  hypotension, 
and evidence of vital organ hypoperfusion (e.g., clouded sensorium, 
cool extremities, oliguria, acidosis). Patients with cardiogenic shock 
caused  by  STEMI  are  more  likely  to  be  older;  to  have  a  history  of 
diabetes mellitus, previous MI, or congestive heart failure; and to have 
sustained an anterior infarction at the time of development of shock. 
In the past, cardiogenic shock was reported to occur in up to 20% of 
patients with STEMI, but estimates from recent large trials and obser-
vational  data  bases  report  an  incidence  rate  in  the  range  of  5%  to 
8%.130,132,139 When shock occurs, the prognosis remains poor and few 
interventions, with the exception of prompt coronary revasculariza-
tion, conclusively provide benefit.131

Pathologic Findings
At autopsy, more than two thirds of patients with cardiogenic shock 
demonstrate multivessel coronary disease, usually including the left 
anterior descending coronary artery. Almost all patients with cardio-
genic shock exhibit thrombotic occlusion of the artery supplying the 
major  region  of  recent  infarction,  with  loss  of  40%  or  more  of  left 
ventricular mass.130 Patients who die of cardiogenic shock often have 
piecemeal necrosisthat is, progressive myocardial necrosis from 
marginal extension of the infarct into an ischemic zone bordering on 
the  infarction.  This  finding  is  generally  associated  with  persistent 
elevation  of cardiac  biomarkers. Such extensions and  focal  lesions 
probably result in part from the shock state itself. Early deterioration 
of  left  ventricular  function  secondary  to  apparent  extension  of  the 
infarction in some cases may result from expansion of the necrotic 
zone of myocardium without actual extension of the necrotic process. 
The hydrodynamic force that develops during ventricular systole can 
disrupt  necrotic  myocardial  muscle  bundles  with  resultant  expan-
sion and thinning of the akinetic zone of myocardium, which in turn 
results in deterioration of overall left ventricular function.

Other causes of cardiogenic shock in patients with STEMI include 
mechanical defects such as rupture of the ventricular septum, a papil-
lary muscle, or a free wall with tamponade; right ventricular infarc-
tion; or a marked reduction in preload caused by conditions such as 
hypovolemia.130,132

Pathophysiology
The shock state in patients with STEMI appears to be the result of a 
vicious cycle, as demonstrated in Figure 51-14 (see Chapter 51).

Diagnosis
Cardiogenic  shock  is  characterized  by  marked  and  persistent  (>30 
minutes)  hypotension  with  systolic  arterial  pressure  lower  than 
90 mm Hg and a reduction in the cardiac index (<2.2 liters/min/m2) 
in  the  presence  of  elevated  left  ventricular  filling  pressure  (pulmo-
nary capillary wedge pressure >18 mm Hg). Spurious estimates of left 
ventricular end-diastolic pressure based on measurements of pulmo-
nary artery wedge pressure can occur in patients with marked mitral 
regurgitation, in which the tall v wave in the left atrial (and pulmo-
nary  artery  wedge)  pressure  tracing  elevates  the  mean  pressure 
above  left  ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure.  Accordingly,  mitral 
regurgitation and other mechanical lesions such as ventricular septal 
defect, ventricular aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm must be excluded 
before the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock caused by impairment of 
left  ventricular  function  can  be  established.  Mechanical  complica-
tions should be suspected in any patient with STEMI in whom circula-
tory  collapse  occurs.  Immediate  hemodynamic,  angiographic,  and 

1123

echocardiographic evaluations are necessary in patients with cardio-
genic  shock.  It  is  important  to  exclude  mechanical  complications 
because primary therapy for such lesions usually requires immediate 
invasive  treatment  with  intervening  support  of  the  circulation  by 
intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.

Medical Management
When the aforementioned mechanical complications are not present, 
cardiogenic shock is caused by impairment of left ventricular func-
tion.  Inotropic  and  vasopressor  agents  may  be  used  as  pharmaco-
logic  support  and  should  be  administered  at  the  lowest  possible 
doses. Although dopamine or dobutamine generally improves hemo-
dynamics in these patients, unfortunately, neither appears to improve 
hospital survival significantly. Similarly, vasodilators have been used 
in an effort to elevate cardiac output and to reduce left ventricular 
filling pressure, but by lowering the already markedly reduced coro-
nary perfusion pressure, myocardial perfusion can be compromised 
further  and  accelerate  the  vicious  cycle  illustrated  in  Figure  51-14. 
Vasodilators  may  nonetheless  be  used  in  conjunction  with  intra-
aortic balloon counterpulsation (see the section Mechanical Support) 
and inotropic agents to increase cardiac output while sustaining or 
elevating coronary perfusion pressure.

Patients  with  cardiogenic  shock  usually  have  elevated  systemic 
vascular resistance, but occasionally resistance is normal, and in a 
few cases vasodilation actually predominates. When systemic vascu-
lar resistance is not elevated (i.e., <1800 dynes/sec/cm5) in patients 
with cardiogenic shock, norepinephrine, which has both alpha- and 
beta-adrenergic agonist properties (in doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg/
min),  can  increase  diastolic  arterial  pressure,  maintain  coronary  
perfusion,  and  improve  contractility.  Alpha-adrenergic  agents  such 
as  phenylephrine  are  contraindicated  in  patients  with  cardiogenic 
shock  (unless  systemic  vascular  resistance  is  inordinately  low). 
Calcium-sensitizing  agents,  such  as  levosimendan,  may  have  some 
beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, but these medications 
have shown little incremental value in randomized trials.140

Mechanical Support (See Chapter 29)
In patients in whom pharmacologic support is failing because of end-
organ hypoperfusion, initiation of mechanical circulatory support is 
reasonable  (Fig.  52-24),  but  no  definitive  evidence  has  yet  shown 
that this strategy improves outcomes.141

Intra-Aortic Balloon Counterpulsation
Intra-aortic  balloon  counterpulsation  is  used  for  the  treatment  of 
STEMI  in  three  groups  of  patients:  (1)  those  whose  conditions  are 
hemodynamically unstable and in whom support of the circulation 
is required for the performance of cardiac catheterization and angi-
ography carried out to assess lesions that are potentially correctable 
surgically or by angioplasty, (2) those with cardiogenic shock that is 
unresponsive  to  medical  management,  and  rarely,  (3)  those  with 
refractory ischemia that is unresponsive to other treatments or who 
are waiting for definitive revascularization. In experimental animals, 
intra-aortic  balloon  counterpulsation  decreases  preload,  increases 
coronary  blood  flow,  and  improves  cardiac  performance.  Unfortu-
nately,  the  improvement  is  often  only  temporary  in  patients  with 
cardiogenic shock. Although a response to intra-aortic balloon coun-
terpulsation correlates with better outcomes in observational studies 
and  small  randomized  trials,  in  the  largest  randomized  trial  con-
ducted to date, counterpulsation alone did not improve overall sur-
vival  in  patients  with  cardiogenic  shock  secondary  to  MI  (Fig. 
52-25).142 Nor was a benefit observed in any clinically relevant sub-
groups. Nevertheless, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is reason-
able  in  patients  with  cardiogenic  shock  whose  condition  does  not 
stabilize with other interventions and as a bridge to recovery or more 
advanced therapies.1

support.  A,  Intra-aortic  balloon  pump  inserted  into  the  descending  aorta  between  the  arch  vessels  and  renal  arteries. 
B, Impella Recover (Abiomed, Aachen, Germany). This rotational flow device is percutaneously inserted via the femoral 
artery and positioned across the aortic valve, with flow intake in the left ventricle and outflow in the aorta. C, TandemHeart 
(CardiacAssist, Inc., Pittsburgh). A cannula is inserted percutaneously through the right femoral vein and advanced toward 
the  right  atrium,  where  it  is  introduced  by  transatrial  septal  perforation,  to  establish  inflow  into  an  external  rotational 
motor. A cannula in either femoral artery then provides the outflow. (Modified from Desai NR, Bhatt DL: Evaluating per-
cutaneous support for cardiogenic shock: Data shock and sticker shock. Eur Heart J 30:2073, 2009.)

cannulation  of  the  left  femoral  vein  and  advancement  to  the  left 
atrium  via  transseptal  puncture.  Blood  from  the  left  atrium  is  then 
returned by a nonpulsatile motor into the femoral artery. This system 
may provide up to 5 liters/min of flow. Small randomized trials have 
not revealed any mortality advantage over intra-aortic balloon coun-
terpulsation,130,141,143  but  hemodynamic  improvement  is  greater  with 
the percutaneous left ventricular assist device. Another percutaneous 
alternative is a motorized device placed across the aortic valve that 
delivers continuous flow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta 
and provides hemodynamic support superior to that achieved with 
an  intra-aortic  balloon  pump  in  patients  with  MI.144  Additionally, 
lactate levels have been reduced with these devices, thus suggesting 
improved organ perfusion, although 30-day mortality remains high.145 
Surgically placed left ventricular devices as a bridge to transplanta-
tion or as a destination therapy are discussed in Chapter 29.

Complications
Complications  of  intra-aortic  balloon  counterpulsation  include 
damage to or perforation of the aortic wall, ischemia distal to the site 
of insertion of the balloon in the femoral artery, thrombocytopenia, 
hemolysis, atheroemboli, infection, and mechanical failure such as 
rupture  of  the  balloon,  as  well  as  complications  stemming  directly 
from the anticoagulation required. Because of the potential for vas-
cular bleeding complications, physicians have been reluctant to use 
intra-aortic  pumps  in  patients  who  have  undergone  fibrinolytic 
therapy. However, despite the increased bleeding risk, this modality 
should  be  considered  in  selected  patients  who  are  candidates  for  
an  aggressive  approach  to  revascularization  because  of  the  poor 
outcome in those with shock following thrombolysis (usually associ-
ated with ineffective thrombolysis). In addition to vascular complica-
tions, percutaneous left ventricular assist devices are associated with 
the  development  of  systemic  inflammatory  response  syndrome  in 
some patients.146

Revascularization
Of the five therapies frequently used to treat patients with cardiogenic 
shock  (vasopressors,  mechanical  support,  fibrinolysis,  PCI,  and 
CABG), the first two are useful temporizing maneuvers. Revascular-
ization, however, appears to improve survival.

The SHOCK (SHould we emergently revascularize Occluded Coro-
naries for cardiogenic shocK?) study evaluated early revasculariza-
tion for the treatment of patients with MI complicated by cardiogenic 

shock.130 Patients with shock caused 
by left ventricular failure complicat-
ing STEMI were randomly assigned 
to  emergency 
revascularization 
(n = 152)  accomplished  by  either 
CABG  or  angioplasty  or  to  initial 
medical  stabilization  (n = 150).  In 
86% of patients in both groups, intra-
aortic balloon counterpulsation was 
performed.  The  primary  endpoint 
was all-cause mortality at 30 days; a 
secondary  endpoint  was  mortality 
at  6  months.  At  30  days  the  overall 
mortality  rate  was  46.7%  in  the 
revascularization  groupnot  sig-
nificantly  different  from  the  56% 
mortality 
the 
medical  therapy  group  (P = 0.11). 
Subgroups of patients in the SHOCK 
study who showed benefit from the 
early revascularization strategy (i.e., 
reduced  6-month  mortality)  were 
those  younger  than  75  years,  those 
with  a  previous  MI,  and  those  ran-
domly  assigned  less  than  6  hours 
from  the  onset  of  infarction.  Long-
term survival improved significantly 
in  patients  with  cardiogenic  shock 
who  underwent  early  revascularization  (Fig.  52-26).  A  subsequent 
observational  study  of  patients  with  MI  complicated  by  shock  indi-
cated that well-selected elderly patients undergoing PCI had a 1-year 
survival  similar  to  that  in  younger  patients  undergoing  early 
revascularization.147

Recommendations
We recommend individualized assessment of patients to determine 
their  desire  for  aggressive  care  and  overall  candidacy  for  further 
treatment  (e.g.,  age,  mental  status,  comorbid  conditions).  Patients 
with shock who are potential candidates for revascularization should 
be revascularized, which may include revascularization of significant 
stenoses  in  non-culprit  arteries,  with  PCI  and/or  CABG.  In  patients 
with STEMI and shock, in whom PCI or CABG is not suitable, fibrino-
lytic agents can be given unless they have a contraindication.1 Intra-
aortic  balloon  counterpulsation  and  left  ventricular  assist  devices 
may be considered in patients with refractory shock whose condition 
does not stabilize with other therapies.

RightVentricularInfarction
The clinical features of right ventricular infarction range from mild 
right  ventricular  dysfunction  to  cardiogenic  shock.  Characteristic 
electrocardiographic  manifestations  and  hemodynamic  patterns 
(Fig. 52-27) have been observed in patients with clinically significant 
right ventricular infarction, which accompanies approximately a third 
of  inferior  left  ventricular  infarctions.  Right-sided  heart  filling  pres-
sures (central venous, right atrial, and right ventricular end-diastolic) 
are elevated, whereas left ventricular filling pressure is normal or only 
slightly  raised;  right  ventricular  systolic  and  pulse  pressures  are 
decreased, and cardiac output is often markedly depressed.

Diagnosis
Many patients with the combination of a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure and depressed cardiac index have right ventricular infarcts 
(with  accompanying  inferior  left  ventricular  infarcts).  The  hemody-
namic picture may superficially resemble that seen in patients with 
pericardial  disease  (see  Chapter  71)  and  includes  elevated  right 
ventricular filling pressure; a steep, right atrial y descent; and an early 
diastolic drop and plateau (resembling the square root sign) in the 
right ventricular pressure tracing. Moreover, patients with right ven-
tricular  infarction  may  display  the  Kussmaul  sign  (an  increase  in

fall in systolic pressure >10 mm Hg with inspiration) (Fig. 52-27). In 
fact, the Kussmaul sign in the setting of inferior STEMI is highly pre-
dictive of right ventricular involvement.

The ECG can provide the first clue to right ventricular involvement 
in patients with inferior STEMI (Fig. 52-27). Most patients with right 
ventricular  infarction  have  ST-segment  elevation  in  lead  V4R  (right 

precordial  lead  in  the  V4  position).1  Transient  elevation  of  the  ST 
segment  in  any  of  the  right  precordial  leads  can  occur  with  right 
ventricular MI, and the presence of ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV or 
greater  in  any  one  or  a  combination  of  leads  V4R,  V5R,  and  V6R  in 
patients with the clinical picture of acute MI points to the diagnosis 
of right ventricular MI. In addition to noting the presence or absence 
of  convex  upward  ST  elevation  in  V4R,  clinicians  should  determine

whether  the  T  wave  is  positive  or  negativesuch  distinctions  help 
distinguish  proximal  versus  distal  occlusion  of  the  right  coronary 
artery versus occlusion of the left circumflex artery (Fig. 52-27). Eleva-
tion of the ST segments in leads V1 through V4 caused by right ven-
tricular  infarction  can  be  confused  with  elevation  caused  by 
anteroseptal  infarction.  Although  the  elevated  ST  segments  are  ori-
ented anteriorly in both cases, the frontal plane can provide impor-
tant  cluesthe  ST  segments  are  oriented  to  the  right  with  right 
ventricular infarction (e.g., +120 degrees), whereas they are oriented 
to the left with anteroseptal infarction (e.g., 30 degrees).

Noninvasive Assessment
Echocardiography  helps  in  the  differential  diagnosis  because  in 
patients  with  right  ventricular  infarction,  in  contrast  to  pericardial 
tamponade, little or no pericardial fluid accumulates. The echocar-
diogram shows abnormal wall motion of the right ventricle, as well 
as  right  ventricular  dilation  and  depression  of  the  right  ventricular 
ejection fraction.148 MRI can also aid in recognition of right ventricu-
lar  infarction.149  Impaired  right  ventricular  function  delineated  by 
either  modality  has  been  associated  with  increased  mortality  after 
MI.150 Additionally, shock from isolated right ventricular dysfunction 
carries almost as high a mortality risk as left ventricular shock does; 
serial studies have shown, however, that some degree of ventricular 
recovery is more common with right ventricular infarction than with 
left ventricular infarction.130

Treatment
Because  of  their  ability  to  reduce  preload,  medications  routinely 
prescribed for left ventricular infarction may produce profound hypo-
tension  in  patients  with  right  ventricular  infarction.  Specifically, 
nitrates and diuretics should be avoided. In patients with hypotension 
caused by right ventricular MI, hemodynamics can be improved by 
a combination of expansion of plasma volume to augment right ven-
tricular preload and cardiac output and, when left ventricular failure 
is present, arterial vasodilators.1 If hypotension has not responded to 

1127

brisk  administration  of  1  or  more  liters  of  fluid,  however,  consider-
ation should be given to hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary 
artery catheter because further volume infusion may be of little use 
and  could  produce  pulmonary  congestion.  Arterial  vasodilators 
reduce  the  impedance  to  left  ventricular  outflow  and,  in  turn,  left 
ventricular diastolic, left atrial, and pulmonary (arterial) pressure
thereby lowering impedance to right ventricular outflow and enhanc-
ing right ventricular output.

In patients requiring pacing, ventricular pacing may fail to increase 
cardiac  output,  and  AV  sequential  pacing  may  be  needed.  Right 
ventricular infarction is common in patients with inferior left ventricu-
lar  infarction.  Therefore  otherwise  unexplained  systemic  arterial 
hypotension with diminished cardiac output or marked hypotension 
in response to small doses of nitroglycerin in patients with inferior 
infarction  should  lead  to  prompt  consideration  of  this  diagnosis. 
Patients  requiring  pacing  should  undergo  atrial  or  AV  sequential 
pacing.  Successful  reperfusion  of  the  right  coronary  artery  signifi-
cantly  improves  right  ventricular  mechanical  function  and  lowers 
in-hospital  mortality  in  patients  with  right  ventricular  infarction. 
Replacement of the tricuspid valve and repair of the valve with annu-
loplasty rings have been performed for the treatment of severe tricus-
pid regurgitation caused by right ventricular infarction.

MechanicalCausesofHeartFailure
The most dramatic complications of STEMI involve tearing or rupture 
of acutely infarcted tissue (see Fig. 52-33). The clinical characteristics 
of these lesions vary considerably and depend on the site of rupture, 
which may involve the free wall of either ventricle, the interventricu-
lar septum, or the papillary muscles. The overall incidence of these 
complications,  although  difficult  to  assess  because  clinical  and 
autopsy series differ considerably, appears to be decreasing with the 
increasing  use  of  reperfusion  therapy.151,152  Table  52-11  shows  the 
comparative clinical profile of these complications, as gathered from 
different studies.

Free Wall Rupture
The clinical course of rupture varies from catastrophic, with an acute 
tear leading to tamponade and immediate death, to subacute, with 
nausea,  hypotension,  and  pericardial  discomfort  being  the  major 
clinical  clues  to  its  presence  (Table  52-11).  The  tear  is  usually  pre-
ceded by a large infarct with subsequent expansion, sometimes with 
a dissecting hematoma, and occurs near the junction of the infarct 
and  normal  muscle.  Rupture  is  more  common  in  the  left  ventricle 
(specifically,  the  anterior  or  lateral  wall)  than  in  the  right  ventricle 
and seldom occurs in the atria. Other features associated with rupture 
include  reperfusion  with  a  fibrinolytic  agent  versus  PCI,  older  age, 
female sex, hypertension, the absence of collateral circulation, and 
a first MI.152 Survival depends on recognition of this complication, on 
hemodynamic  stabilization  of  the  patientusually  with  inotropic 
agents and/or an intra-aortic balloon pumpand most importantly, 
on prompt surgical repair.1

Pseudoaneurysm
Incomplete rupture of the heart may occur when organizing throm-
bus and hematoma, together with pericardium, seal a rupture of the 
left ventricle and thus prevent the development of hemopericardium 
(Fig. 52-28). With time, this area of organized thrombus and pericar-
dium  can  become  a  pseudoaneurysm  (false  aneurysm)  that  main-
tains communication with the cavity of the left ventricle. In contrast 
to true aneurysms, which always contain some myocardial elements 
in their walls, the walls of pseudoaneurysms are composed of orga-
nized hematoma and pericardium and lack any elements of the origi-
nal myocardial wall. Pseudoaneurysms can become quite large, even 
equaling  the  true  ventricular  cavity  in  size,  and  they  communicate 
with  the  left  ventricular  cavity  through  a  narrow  neck.  Frequently, 
pseudoaneurysms  contain  significant  quantities  of  old  and  recent 
thrombi, the superficial portions of which can cause arterial emboli. 
Pseudoaneurysms can drain off a portion of each ventricular stroke 
volume, exactly as true aneurysms do. The diagnosis of pseudoaneu-
rysm  can  usually  be  made  by  echocardiography  and  contrast-
enhanced  angiography,150  although  differentiation  between  a  true 
aneurysm  and  a  pseudoaneurysm  can  sometimes  be  difficult  with 
any imaging technique.

Diagnosis
Myocardial free wall rupture is usually accompanied by sudden pro-
found  shock,  often  rapidly  leading  to  pulseless  electrical  activity 
caused by pericardial tamponade. Immediate pericardiocentesis can 
confirm the diagnosis and relieve the pericardial tamponade, at least 
momentarily.  If  the  patients  condition  is  relatively  stable,  echocar-
diography may help in establishing the diagnosis of tamponade.150

Treatment
In  patients  with  critically  compromised  hemodynamics,  establish-
ment  of  the  diagnosis  should  be  followed  immediately  by  surgical 
resection  of  the  necrotic  and  ruptured  myocardium  with  primary 
reconstruction. When the rupture is subacute and a pseudoaneurysm 
is suspected or present, prompt elective surgery is indicated because 
rupture of the pseudoaneurysm can occur relatively frequently.153

Rupture of the Interventricular Septum
As in rupture of the free wall of the ventricle, transmural infarction 
underlies  rupture  of  the  ventricular  septum.  The  perforation  can 
range in length from one to several centimeters (Fig. 52-29). It can 
be a direct through-and-through opening or more irregular and ser-
piginous. Rupture of the septum with an anterior infarction tends to 
be apical in location, whereas inferior infarctions are associated with 
perforation of the basal septum and have a worse prognosis than do 
those in an anterior location.

Clinical features associated with increased risk for rupture of the 
interventricular  septum  include  lack  of  development  of  a  collateral 
network,  advanced  age,  female  sex,  and  chronic  kidney  disease 
(Table 52-12). Because previous ischemia induces myocardial pre-
conditioning, thereby decreasing the likelihood of transmural myo-
cardial  necrosis  and  septal  rupture,  patients  with  evidence  of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic angina, or previous MI are 
less likely to experience rupture.132

A ruptured interventricular septum is characterized by the appear-
ance of a new harsh, loud holosystolic murmur that is heard best at 
the lower left sternal border and is usually accompanied by a thrill. 
Biventricular failure generally ensues within hours to days. The defect 
can also be recognized by echocardiography with color flow Doppler

tricular septum after STEMI confers high 30-day mortality.152 The likeli-
hood of survival depends on the degree of impairment of ventricular 
function and the size of the defect, but because the rupture site can 
expand,  prompt  surgical  repair  is  necessary  even  in  hemodynami-

FIGURE52-30  Echocardiography of two ventricular septal defects (VSDs) that developed after STEMI. A close-up of the ventricular septum in an apical four-chamber 
view  demonstrates  turbulent  systolic  color  flow  Doppler  across  a  VSD  and  continuous-wave  Doppler  demonstrates  systolic  flow  across  a  VSD  (left).  (From  Kamran  M, 
Attari M, Webber G: Images in cardiovascular medicine. Ventricular septal defect complicating an acute myocardial infarction. Circulation 112:e337, 2005.) A subcoastal 
view demonstrates color flow Doppler across a VSD (right). (From Brigham and Womens Hospital, 2013.) LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle. 

As  with  patients  who  have  a  ruptured  ventricular  septal  defect, 
those  with  papillary  muscle  rupture  manifest  a  new  holosystolic 
murmur and have increasingly severe heart failure.155 In both condi-
tions the murmur may become softer or disappear as arterial pressure 
falls. Mitral regurgitation secondary to partial or complete rupture of 
a papillary muscle can be recognized promptly with echocardiogra-
phy. Color flow Doppler imaging is particularly helpful in distinguish-
ing acute mitral regurgitation from a ventricular septal defect in the 
setting of STEMI (Table 52-11).1,154 An echocardiogram should there-
fore be obtained immediately for any patient in whom the diagnosis 
is suspected because hemodynamic deterioration can ensue rapidly. 
Echocardiography  also  often  permits  differentiation  of  papillary 
muscle rupture from other, generally less severe forms of mitral regur-
gitation that occur with STEMI.

Differentiation Between Ventricular Septal Rupture  
and Mitral Regurgitation
Distinguishing on clinical grounds between acute mitral regurgitation 
and rupture of the ventricular septum in patients with STEMI in whom 
a  loud  systolic  murmur  suddenly  develops  may  be  difficult.155  Such 
differentiation  can  be  made  most  readily  by  color  flow  Doppler  
echocardiography.  In  addition,  right-heart  catheterization  with  a 
balloon-tipped  catheter  can  readily  distinguish  between  these  two 
complications. Patients with ventricular septal rupture demonstrate 
a  step-up  in  oxygen  saturation  in  blood  samples  from  the  right 
ventricle  and  pulmonary  artery  as  compared  with  those  from  the 
right atrium. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation lack this step-up; 
they may demonstrate tall c-v waves in both the pulmonary capillary 
and pulmonary arterial pressure tracings.

Management
Invasive monitoring is generally indicated on recognition of a major 
mechanical complication of STEMI. Right and left ventricular filling 
pressures (right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pres-
sure) guide fluid administration or the use of diuretics, whereas mea-
surements  of  cardiac  output  and  mean  arterial  pressure  permit 
calculation  of  systemic  vascular  resistance  to  direct  vasodilator 
therapy. For acute mitral regurgitation and ventricular septal defects, 
unless systolic pressure is below 90 mm Hg, this therapy, which gen-
erally  involves  nitroglycerin  or  nitroprusside,  should  be  instituted  
as  soon  as  possible  once  hemodynamic  monitoring  is  available.  
Inotropes may also be needed to support adequate cardiac output. 
These  interventions  may  be  critically  important  for  stabilizing  the 
patients condition in preparation for further diagnostic studies and

Womens Hospital, Boston.)

not necessarily overwhelming mitral regurgitation is much more fre-
quent and is not immediately fatal (Fig. 52-31). Inferior wall infarc-
tion can lead to rupture of the posteromedial papillary muscle, which 
because  of  its  singular  blood  supply,  occurs  more  commonly  than 
does rupture of the anterolateral muscle, a consequence of anterolat-
eral MI. Unlike rupture of the ventricular septum, which occurs with 
large infarcts, papillary muscle rupture occurs with a relatively small 
infarction in approximately half of cases. These patients can some-
times have a modest extent of CAD as well. Rupture of a right ven-
tricular papillary muscle is unusual but can cause massive tricuspid 
regurgitation  and  right  ventricular  failure.  In  a  small  number  of 
patients,  rupture  of  more  than  one  cardiac  structure  is  noted  clini-
cally  or  at  postmortem  examination;  all  possible  combinations  of 
rupture of the left ventricular free wall, the interventricular septum, 
and the papillary muscles can occur.

repair. If pharmacologic therapy is not tolerated or if it fails to achieve  
hemodynamic stability, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should 
be  instituted  rapidly.  Intra-aortic  balloon  counterpulsation  should  
be  considered  for  most  patients  with  acute  mechanical  complica-
tions of STEMI.

Operative  intervention  is  most  successful  in  patients  with  STEMI 
and  circulatory  collapse  when  a  surgically  correctable  mechanical 
lesion such as a ventricular septal defect or ruptured papillary muscle 
can be identified and addressed. In most cases, surgery should not 
be  delayed  in  patients  with  a  correctable  lesion  who  agree  to  an 
aggressive management strategy and require pharmacologic and/or 
mechanical  (counterpulsation)  support.1  In  such  patients  a  serious 
complication  frequently  developsinfection,  adult  respiratory  dis-
tress syndrome, extension of the infarct, or renal failureif surgery 
is delayed. Surgical survival is predicted by early surgery, short dura-
tion of shock, and mild degrees of right and left ventricular impair-
ment.152,156 In a subset of patients whose hemodynamic status remains 
stable,  the  operation  may  be  postponed  for  2  to  4  weeks  to  allow 
some  healing  of  the  infarct.  Such  decisions  regarding  the  optimal 
timing of surgery are complicated and require integration of multiple 
aspects of the clinical course, as well as the anatomy of the mechani-
cal complication, by a multidisciplinary team. Surgical repair involves 
correction  of  mitral  regurgitation,  insertion  of  a  prosthetic  mitral 
valve, or closure of a ventricular septal defect, usually accompanied 
by coronary revascularization (Figs. 52-32 and 52-33).

Catheter-based options for repair of ventricular septal defects may 
be appropriate in patients who are not candidates for early definitive 
surgical  correction.146,157  Because  complete  closure  of  the  defect, 
however, requires time for the device to thrombose and endothelial-
ize, in most patients with hemodynamically significant mechanical 
complications, surgical management is the best established manage-
ment option.1

ARRHYTHMIAS(SeealsoChapters37
Through39)

Arrhythmias that can complicate the course of patients with STEMI, 
as well as their prevention and treatment in this setting, are discussed 
here  and  summarized  in  Table  52-12.  Many  serious  arrhythmias 
develop before hospitalization, even before the patient is monitored. 
Some  abnormality  in  cardiac  rhythm  also  occurs  in  many  patients 
with  STEMI  treated  in  the  hospital.  These  arrhythmias  can  include 
both tachycardic and bradycardic episodes, both of which have the 
ability to provoke hemodynamic consequences.

Hemodynamic Consequences
Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction have a relatively 
fixed stroke volume and depend on changes in the heart rate to alter 
cardiac  output.  However,  the  range  of  heart  rate  with  maximal 
cardiac  output  is  narrow:  either  faster  or  slower  rates  can  cause 
reductions in output. Thus all forms of tachycardia and bradycardia 
can depress cardiac output in patients with STEMI. Although optimal 
cardiac output may require a rate higher than 100 beats/min, because 
heart  rate  is  one  of  the  major  determinants  of  myocardial  oxygen 
consumption,  more  rapid  heart  rates  elevate  myocardial  energy 
needs  to  levels  that  can  adversely  affect  ischemic  myocardium.  In 
patients with STEMI, therefore, the optimal rate is usually lowerin 
the range of 60 to 80 beats/min.

A second factor to consider in assessing the hemodynamic conse-
quences of a particular arrhythmia is loss of the atrial contribution 
to ventricular preload. Studies of patients without STEMI have dem-
onstrated that loss of atrial transport decreases left ventricular output 
by  15%  to  20%.  In  patients  with  reduced  diastolic  left  ventricular 
compliance of any cause (including STEMI), however, atrial systole 
is  of  greater  importance  for  left  ventricular  filling.  In  patients  with 
STEMI,  atrial  systole  boosts  end-diastolic  volume  by  approximately 
15%, end-diastolic pressure by 30%, and stroke volume by 35%.

Ventricular Premature Depolarizations

five per minute), VPCs with a multiform configuration, early coupling 
(the  R-on-T  phenomenon),  and  repetitive  patterns  in  the  form  of 
couplets  or  salvos  were  thought  to  presage  VF.  It  is  now  clear, 
however, that as many patients in whom fibrillation does not develop 
as those in whom it does have such warning arrhythmias. Several 
reports have shown that primary VF (see later) occurs without ante-
cedent warning arrhythmias and may even develop despite suppres-
sion of warning arrhythmias. Both primary VF and VPCs, especially 
R-on-T beats, occur during the early phase of STEMI, when consider-
able  heterogeneity  in  electrical  activity  is  present.  Although  R-on-T 
beats  expose  this  heterogeneity  and  can  precipitate  VF  in  a  small 
minority of patients, the ubiquitous nature of VPCs in patients with 
STEMI and the extremely infrequent nature of VF in the current era 
of  STEMI  management  produce  unacceptably  low  sensitivity  and 
specificity of the electrocardiographic patterns observed on monitor-
ing systems for identifying patients at risk for VF.

Management
The  incidence  of  VF  in  patients  with  STEMI  seen  in  CCUs  over  the 
past three decades appears to have declined. The previous practice 
of prophylactic suppression of ventricular premature beats with anti-
arrhythmic drugs is not indicated and may actually increase the risk 
for  fatal  bradycardic  and  asystolic  events.1  We  therefore  pursue  a 
conservative course when VPCs are observed in patients with STEMI 
and  do  not  routinely  prescribe  antiarrhythmic  drugs,  other  than 
beta blockers, but instead determine whether recurrent ischemia or 
electrolyte  or  metabolic  disturbances  are  present.1  When  VPCs 
accompany sinus tachycardia at the inception of an infarction, aug-
mented sympathoadrenal stimulation often contributes and can be 
treated by beta-adrenergic blockade. In fact, early administration of 
an intravenous beta blocker effectively reduces the incidence of VF 
in cases of evolving MI.158

Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm
An  accelerated  idioventricular  rhythm  typically  occurs  during  the 
first 2 days, with about equal frequency in anterior and inferior infarc-
tions. Most episodes are of short duration. Accelerated idioventricular 
rhythm  is  often  observed  shortly  after  successful  reperfusion  has 
been  established  with  fibrinolytic  therapy.  However,  the  frequent 
occurrence  of  this  rhythm  in  patients  without  reperfusion  limits  its 
reliability  as  a  marker  of  the  restoration  of  patency  of  the  infarct-
related coronary artery and may have different implications following 
primary  PCI.159  In  contrast  to  rapid  VT,  accelerated  idioventricular 
rhythm  is  thought  not  to  affect  prognosis,  and  we  do  not  routinely 
treat accelerated idioventricular rhythms.

Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation
A leading hypothesis for a major mechanism of ventricular arrhyth-
mias in the acute phase of coronary occlusion is reentry caused by 
inhomogeneity of the electrical characteristics of ischemic myocar-
dium.160 The cellular electrophysiologic mechanisms for reperfusion 
arrhythmias appear to include washout of various ions such as lactate 
and  potassium  and  toxic  metabolic  substances  that  have  accumu-
lated in the ischemic zone. VT and/or VF occurring late in the course 
of STEMI is more common in patients with transmural infarction and 
left  ventricular  dysfunction  and  is  more  frequently  associated  with 
hemodynamic deterioration.

Prophylaxis
Because hypokalemia can increase the risk for development of VT, 
low serum potassium levels should be identified quickly after admis-
sion for STEMI and should be treated promptly.161 Despite the lack of 
a consistent relationship between hypomagnesemia and ventricular 
arrhythmias, magnesium deficits may still be linked to risk because 
patients with STEMI have reduced intracellular magnesium levels not 
adequately reflected by serum measurements. As noted earlier, mag-
nesium  should  be  repleted  to  achieve  a  serum  level  of  2 mEq/liter. 
Early  beta  blocker  use  has  reduced  VF  and  can  be  instituted  in 
patients without contraindication. Lidocaine prophylaxis to prevent 
primary VF is no longer advised.1

Management
Treatment of unstable VT or VF consists of electrical cardioversion 
implemented as rapidly as possible. Successful interruption of unsta-
ble ventricular arrhythmias or prevention of refractory recurrent epi-
sodes  can  also  be  facilitated  by  the  intravenous  administration  of 
amiodarone. We do not usually administer bicarbonate injections to 
correct acidosis because of the high osmotic load that they impose 
and because hyperventilation of the patient is probably a more suit-
able means of clearing the acidosis. After reversion to sinus rhythm, 
every effort should be made to correct any underlying abnormalities 
such as hypoxia, hypotension, acid-base or electrolyte disturbances, 
and  digitalis  excess.  Urgent  attempts  at  revascularization  are  war-
ranted if ventricular arrhythmias are ongoing and caused by ische-
mia.  The  use  of  extended  antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy,  such  as 
amiodarone or lidocaine, is discussed in Chapter 37. In patients with 
sustained  VT  or  VF  successfully  treated  at  a  time  after  successful 
reperfusion,  we  generally  continue  antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy, 
most often amiodarone, until a defibrillator is placed.

Failure  of  electrical  cardioversion  to  restore  an  effective  cardiac 
rhythm  is  almost  always  caused  by  rapidly  recurrent  VT  or  VF,  by 
electromechanical  dissociation,  or  rarely,  by  electrical  asystole. 
When synchronous cardiac electrical activity is restored by counter-
shock but contraction is ineffective (i.e., pulseless electrical activity), 
the  underlying  cause  is  usually  extensive  myocardial  ischemia  or 
necrosis or rupture of the ventricular free wall or septum.

The  highest  rates  of  successful  treatment  of  VT/VF  occur  in  the 
intensive  care  setting.  When  ventricular  arrhythmias  occur  outside 
an intensive care unit, resuscitative efforts are much less likely to be 
successful, primarily because the time interval between onset of the 
episode and institution of definitive therapy tends to be prolonged.

Prognosis
Among patients who underwent fibrinolytic therapy in the GUSTO-I 
(Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activa-
tor for Occluded Coronary Arteries) study, approximately 10% expe-
rienced  VT/VF.  In  the  APEX-AMI  (Assessment  of  Pexelizumab  in 
Acute Myocardial Infarction) study, which included patients treated 
with  primary  PCI,  sustained  VT/VF  developed  in  5.7%.  Clinical  out-
comes were worse in patients with VT/VF than in those without VT/
VF. Additionally, mortality rates were worse in those with early versus 
late VT/VF; specifically, when compared with patients without VT/VF, 
the  risk  for  mortality  at  90  days  increased  twofold  in  patients  with 
both  early  and  late  VT/VF,  respectively.158  In  patients  in  whom  sus-
tained VT/VF develops later in the course after STEMI (e.g., after more 
than 48 hours) without evidence of a reversible cause, implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator  (ICD)  therapy  for  secondary  prevention 
should  be  considered  before  discharge.1  This  situation  differs  from 
that in patients with VT/VF before reperfusion therapy, in whom anti-
arrhythmic therapy other than a beta blocker is not indicated. Indica-
tions for insertion of an ICD for primary prevention in patients with a 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after STEMI are discussed 
later in this chapter.

Bradyarrhythmias(SeeChapters36and37)
Sinus Bradycardia
Sinus  bradycardia  occurs  commonly  during  the  early  phases  of 
STEMI, particularly in patients with inferior and posterior infarctions. 
On the basis of data obtained from experimental infarction and from 
some clinical observations, the increased vagal tone that produces 
sinus bradycardia during the early phase of STEMI may actually be 
beneficial, perhaps because it reduces myocardial oxygen demand. 
Thus  the  acute  mortality  rate  in  patients  with  sinus  bradycardia 
appears to be similar to that in those without this arrhythmia.1

Management
Isolated sinus bradycardia, unaccompanied by hypotension or ven-
tricular ectopy, should be observed rather than treated initially. In the 
first 4 to 6 hours after infarction, if the sinus rate is extremely low (<40 
to  50  beats/min)  and  associated  with  hypotension,  intravenous

atropine in doses of 0.3 to 0.6 mg every 3 to 10 minutes (with a total 
dose not exceeding 3 mg) can be administered to bring the heart rate 
up to approximately 60 beats/min.

Atrioventricular and Intraventricular Block
Ischemic injury can produce conduction block at any level of the AV 
or intraventricular conduction system. Such blocks can occur in the 
AV  node  and  the  bundle  of  His  and  produce  various  grades  of  AV 
block, in either main bundle branch and produce right or left bundle 
branch block, and in the anterior and posterior divisions of the left 
bundle  and  produce  left  anterior  or  left  posterior  (fascicular)  divi-
sional  blocks.  Conduction  disturbances  can,  of  course,  occur  in 
various combinations. The clinical features of proximal and distal AV 
conduction disturbances in patients with STEMI are summarized in 
Table 52-13.

First-Degree Atrioventricular Block
A first-degree AV block does not generally require specific treatment. 
Beta  blockers  and  calcium  antagonists  (other 
than  dihydro-
pyridines) prolong AV conduction and may be responsible for first-
degree  AV  block  as  well,  but  discontinuation  of  the  use  of  these  
drugs in the setting of STEMI could increase ischemia and ischemic 
injury. Therefore we do not decrease the dosage of these drugs unless 
the PR interval is greater than 0.24 second. Use of these agents should 
be  stopped  only  if  a  higher-degree  block  or  hemodynamic  impair-
ment occurs. If the block is a manifestation of excessive vagotonia 
and is associated with sinus bradycardia and hypotension, adminis-
tration  of  atropine,  as  already  outlined,  may  be  helpful.  Continued 

electrocardiographic  monitoring  is  important  in  such  patients  in  
view of the possibility of progression to higher degrees of block.

Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block
First-degree and type I second-degree AV blocks do not appear to affect 
survival, are most commonly associated with occlusion of the right coro-
nary artery, and are caused by ischemia of the AV node (Table 52-13). 
Specific therapy is not required in patients with second-degree type I 
AV  block  when  the  ventricular  rate  exceeds  50  beats/min  and  PVCs, 
heart failure, and bundle branch block are absent. If these complica-
tions develop, however, or if the heart rate falls below approximately 50 
beats/min  and  the  patient  is  symptomatic,  immediate  treatment  with 
atropine  (0.3  to  0.6 mg)  is  indicated;  temporary  pacing  systems  are 
almost never needed in the management of this arrhythmia.

Type II second-degree AV block in the setting of inferior/posterior 
STEMI is usually temporary and is manifested as a narrow-complex/
junctional  escape  rhythm.  These  arrhythmias  can  typically  be 
managed  conservatively.  With  anterior/lateral  STEMI,  a  type  II 
second-degree AV block usually originates from a lesion in the con-
duction system below the bundle of His (Table 52-13). Because of its 
potential  for  progression  to  complete  heart  block,  type  II  second-
degree AV block in this setting should be treated with a temporary 
external or transvenous demand pacemaker.1

Complete (Third-Degree) Atrioventricular Block
Complete AV block can occur in patients with either inferior or ante-
rior infarction, although it is more common in the inferior than in the 
anterior  location.  Complete  heart  block  in  patients  with  inferior

infarction usually develops gradually, often progressing from a first-
degree or type I second-degree block.162 The escape rhythm is typi-
cally  stable  without  asystole  and  often  junctional,  with  a  rate 
exceeding 40 beats/min and a narrow QRS complex in 70% of cases 
and a slower rate and wide QRS complex in the others. This form of 
complete AV block is often transient, may respond to pharmacologic 
antagonism of adenosine with methylxanthines, and resolves in most 
patients within a few days (Table 52-13).

Patients with inferior infarction often have concomitant ischemia 
or infarction of the AV node secondary to hypoperfusion of the AV 
node  artery,  but  the  His-Purkinje  system  usually  escapes  injury  in 
such  individuals.  Patients  with  inferior  STEMI  and  AV  block  have 
larger infarcts and more depressed right ventricular and left ventricu-
lar function than do patients with an inferior infarct and no AV block. 
As already noted, junctional escape rhythms with narrow QRS com-
plexes occur commonly in this setting.

Pacing  is  not  generally  necessary  in  patients  with  inferior  wall 
infarction  and  complete  AV  block  because  it  is  often  transient  in 
nature,  but  it  is  indicated  if  symptoms  related  to  a  ventricular  rate 
emerge,  if  ventricular  arrhythmias  or  hypotension  is  present,  or  if 
pump failure develops; atropine only rarely proves adequate in these 
patients.  Only  when  complete  heart  block  develops  in  less  than  6 
hours after the onset of symptoms is atropine likely to abolish the AV 
block or cause acceleration of the escape rhythm. In such cases the 
AV block is more likely to be transient and to be related to increases 
in vagal tone, as opposed to the more persistent block seen later in 
the course of STEMI, which generally requires cardiac pacing.

In  patients  with  anterior  infarction,  third-degree  AV  block  can 
occur suddenly 12 to 24 hours after the onset of infarction, although 
it is usually preceded by an intraventricular block and often a type II 
(not  first-degree  or  type  I)  AV  block.  Such  patients  typically  have 
unstable  escape  rhythms  with  wide  QRS  complexes  and  rates  less 
than 40 beats/min; ventricular asystole may occur quite suddenly. In 
patients  with  anterior  infarction,  AV  block  generally  develops  as  a 
result of extensive septal necrosis involving the bundle branches. The 
high  rate  of  mortality  in  this  group  of  patients  with  a  slow  idioven-
tricular rhythm and wide QRS complex is the consequence of exten-
sive  myocardial  necrosis  resulting  in  severe  left  ventricular  failure 
and frequently shock (Table 52-13).

Whether  temporary  transvenous  pacing  per  se  improves  survival 
in  patients  with  anterior  STEMI  remains  controversial.  Some  physi-
cians contend that ventricular pacing is of limited efficacy when used 
to correct a complete AV block in patients with anterior infarction in 
view  of  the  poor  prognosis  in  this  group  regardless  of  therapy. 
However,  pacing  protects  against  asystole  and  may  protect  against 
transient hypotension, with its attendant risks of extending the infarc-
tion and precipitating malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Intraventricular Block
The right bundle branch and the left posterior division have a dual 
blood  supply  from  the  left  anterior  descending  and  right  coronary 
arteries, whereas the left anterior division is supplied by septal per-
forators originating from the left anterior descending coronary artery. 
Not all conduction blocks in patients with STEMI are complications 
of infarcts because almost half are already present at the time that 
the first ECG is recorded, and they may represent antecedent conduc-
tion  abnormalities.  When  compared  with  patients  without  conduc-
tion defects, those with STEMI and bundle branch blocks have higher 
peak  biomarker  levels,  lower  ejection  fractions,  and  increased 
in-hospital and long-term mortality rates.163 In the prefibrinolytic era, 
intraventricular  conduction  disturbances  (i.e.,  block  within  one  or 
more of the three subdivisions [fascicles] of the His-Purkinje system 
[the anterior and posterior divisions of the left bundle and the right 
bundle]) occurred in 5% to 10% of patients with STEMI. More recent 
series  in  the  reperfusion  era  suggest  that  intraventricular  blocks 
occur in approximately 2% to 5% of patients with MI.163

Isolated Fascicular Blocks
An isolated left anterior divisional block is unlikely to progress to a 
complete AV block. Mortality is increased in these patients, although 

not as much as in those with other forms of conduction block. The 
posterior fascicle is larger than the anterior fascicle, and in general, 
a larger infarct is required to block it. As a consequence, mortality is 
markedly increased. Complete AV block is not a frequent complica-
tion of either form of isolated divisional block.

Right Bundle Branch Block
This conduction defect alone can lead to AV block because it is often 
a  new  lesion  associated  with  anteroseptal  infarction.  Isolated  right 
bundle branch block is associated with an increased risk for mortal-
ity  in  patients  with  anterior  STEMI  even  if  complete  AV  block  does 
not  occur,  but  this  appears  to  be  the  case  only  if  accompanied  by 
congestive heart failure.

Bifascicular Block, Including Left Bundle Branch Block
The combination of right bundle branch block with either left anterior 
or posterior divisional block or the combination of left anterior and 
posterior divisional blocks (i.e., left bundle branch block) is known 
as bidivisional or bifascicular block. If a new block occurs in two of 
the three divisions of the conduction system, the risk for development 
of a complete AV block is quite high. Mortality is also high because 
of the occurrence of severe pump failure secondary to the extensive 
myocardial necrosis required to produce such an extensive intraven-
tricular block.164

Preexisting bundle branch block or divisional block is less often 
associated  with  the  development  of  complete  AV  block  in  patients 
with STEMI than are conduction defects acquired during the course 
of the infarct. Bidivisional block in the presence of prolongation of 
the  PR  interval  (first-degree  AV  block)  may  indicate  disease  of  the 
third subdivision rather than disease of the AV node and is associated 
with  a  greater  risk  for  complete  heart  block  than  if  first-degree  AV 
block is absent.

Complete bundle branch block (either left or right), the combina-
tion of right bundle branch block and left anterior divisional (fascicu-
lar) block, and any of the various forms of trifascicular block are all 
more often associated with anterior than with inferoposterior infarc-
tion. All these forms are more frequent with large infarcts and in older 
patients and have a higher incidence of other accompanying arrhyth-
mias than seen in patients without bundle branch block.

Use of Pacemakers in Patients with Acute  
Myocardial Infarction (See Chapter 36)
Temporary Pacing
Just  as  is  the  case  for  complete  AV  block,  transvenous  ventricular 
pacing has not resulted in a statistically demonstrable improvement 
in prognosis in patients with STEMI in whom intraventricular conduc-
tion defects develop. Temporary pacing is advisable in some of these 
patients,  however,  because  of  the  high  risk  for  development  of  a 
complete AV block. This category includes patients with new bilateral 
(bifascicular) bundle branch block (i.e., right bundle branch block 
with  left  anterior  or  posterior  divisional  block  and  alternating  right 
and left bundle branch block); first-degree AV block adds to this risk. 
An isolated new block in only one of the three fascicles, even with 
PR prolongation and preexisting bifascicular block and a normal PR 
interval,  poses  somewhat  less  risk;  these  patients  should  be  moni-
tored  closely,  with  insertion  of  a  temporary  pacemaker  deferred 
unless a higher-degree AV block occurs.

Asystole
The presence of apparent ventricular asystole on monitor displays of 
continuously recorded ECGs may be misleading in that the rhythm 
may  actually  be  fine  VF.  The  predominance  of  VF  as  the  cause  of 
cardiac  arrest  in  this  setting  suggests  electrical  countershock  as 
initial therapy, even if definitive electrocardiographic documentation 
of this arrhythmia is not available.

Permanent Pacing
The  advisability  of  permanent  pacemaker  insertion  is  complicated 
because not all sudden deaths in patients with STEMI and conduction 
defects are caused by high-grade AV block. A high incidence of late 

VF occurs in CCU survivors with anterior STEMI complicated by either 
right or left bundle branch block. Therefore VF rather than asystole 
caused by failure of AV conduction and infranodal pacemakers could 
be responsible for late sudden death.

Long-term pacing is often helpful when complete heart block per-
sists  throughout  the  hospital  phase  in  a  patient  with  STEMI,  when 
sinus node function is markedly impaired, or when type II second-
degree  or  third-degree  block  occurs  intermittently.165  When  high-
grade  AV  block  is  associated  with  newly  acquired  bundle  branch 
block or other criteria for conduction system impairment, prophylac-
tic  long-term  pacing  may  be  justified  as  well.  Additional  consider-
ations  that  drive  the  decision  to  insert  a  permanent  pacemaker 
include whether the patient is a candidate for an ICD or has severe 
heart failure that might be improved with biventricular pacing (see 
Chapters 25 and 26).

SupraventricularTachyarrhythmias
(SeeChapters37and38)
Sinus Tachycardia
This arrhythmia is typically associated with augmented sympathetic 
activity  and  may  provoke  transient  hypertension  or  hypotension. 
Common causes are anxiety, persistent pain, left ventricular failure, 
fever,  pericarditis,  hypovolemia,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  the 
administration of drugs such as atropine, epinephrine, or dopamine; 
rarely, it occurs in patients with atrial infarction. Sinus tachycardia is 
particularly common in patients with anterior infarction, especially 
in those with significant accompanying left ventricular dysfunction. 
It is an undesirable rhythm in patients with STEMI because it results 
in  augmentation  of  myocardial  oxygen  consumption,  as  well  as  a 
reduction in the time available for coronary perfusion, thereby inten-
sifying the myocardial ischemia and/or external myocardial necrosis. 
Persistent sinus tachycardia can signify persistent heart failure and, 
in these circumstances, connotes a poor prognosis and excess mor-
tality. An underlying cause should be sought and appropriate treat-
ment instituted, such as analgesics for pain; diuretics for heart failure; 
oxygen, beta blockers, and nitroglycerin for ischemia; and aspirin for 
fever  or  pericarditis.  Treating  sinus  tachycardia  caused  by  pain, 
anxiety, or fever with beta blockers is reasonable, but beta blockers 
are contraindicated in patients who are tachycardic because of pump 
failure.

Atrial Flutter and Fibrillation
Atrial  flutter  and  atrial  fibrillation  are  usually  transient  in  patients 
with STEMI; they are typically a consequence of augmented sympa-
thetic  stimulation  of  the  atria  and  often  occur  in  patients  with  left 
ventricular failure, pulmonary emboli in which the arrhythmia inten-
sifies  hemodynamic  deterioration,  or  atrial  infarction  (see  Table 
52-12). The increased ventricular rate and loss of the atrial contribu-
tion to left ventricular filling can result in a significant reduction in 
cardiac  output.  Atrial  fibrillation  during  STEMI  is  associated  with 
increased mortality and stroke, particularly in patients with anterior 
wall infarction166but because it is more common in patients with 
clinical and hemodynamic manifestations of extensive infarction and 
a  poor  prognosis,  atrial  fibrillation  is  probably  a  marker  of  a  poor 
prognosis  with  only  a  small  independent  contribution  to  increased 
mortality.166

Management
Atrial flutter and fibrillation in patients with STEMI are treated in a 
manner  similar  to  these  conditions  in  other  settings  (see  Chapter 
38). If the arrhythmia is causing ongoing hypotension, ischemia, or 
heart  failure,  cardioversion  should  be  considered.  In  stabilized 
patients  and  in  the  absence  of  contraindications,  a  beta  blocker 
should be administered after STEMI; in addition to several other ben-
efits, these agents help slow the ventricular rate should atrial fibrilla-
tion recur. Digitalis may also help slow the ventricular rate when atrial 
fibrillation develops after STEMI in the setting of ventricular dysfunc-
tion.167 In addition, amiodarone may be considered in this situation. 
Patients with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation should be treated 

with oral anticoagulants (to reduce the risk for stroke), even if sinus 
rhythm is present at the time of hospital discharge, because no antiar-
rhythmic  regimen  can  be  relied  on  to  completely  suppress  atrial 
fibrillation.

OTHERCOMPLICATIONS

RecurrentChestDiscomfort
Evaluation  of  postinfarction  chest  discomfort  is  sometimes  compli-
cated by previous abnormalities on the ECG and a vague description 
of the discomfort by the patient, who either may be exquisitely sensi-
tive to fleeting discomfort or may deny a potential recrudescence of 
symptoms. The critical task for clinicians is to distinguish recurrent 
angina  or  infarction  from  nonischemic  causes  of  discomfort  that 
might be caused by infarct expansion, pericarditis, pulmonary embo-
lism,  and  noncardiac-related  conditions.  Ischemic  causes  to  con-
sider include acute reocclusion of an initially recanalized or stented 
vessel, mechanical or thrombotic occlusion of a side branch or distal 
vessel  during  an  initial  PCI,  new  ischemia  in  a  noninfarct-related 
coronary artery that was also stenosed but not occluded, and coro-
nary spasm. Important diagnostic maneuvers include repeated physi-
cal examination, repeated ECG, and assessment of the response to 
sublingual nitroglycerin, 0.4 mg. (The use of noninvasive diagnostic 
evaluation for recurrent ischemia in patients whose symptoms appear 
only  with  moderate  or  higher  levels  of  exertion  is  discussed  else-
where in this chapter.)

Recurrent Ischemia and Reinfarction
The incidence of postinfarction angina with and without reinfarction 
is significantly reduced in patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI 
versus fibrinolysis. Additionally, in high-risk patients with STEMI who 
were  treated  with  fibrinolysis,  transfer  for  PCI  within  6  hours  after 
fibrinolysis is also associated with significantly fewer ischemic com-
plications  than  is  treatment  with  fibrinolysis  alone.72  More  effective 
antiplatelet and antithrombin therapies have also reduced the rate of 
recurrent ischemic events following STEMI.1 Consequently, the inci-
dence  of  early  recurrent  ischemic  events  in  STEMI  patients  treated 
by immediate or delayed PCI is now in a range of less than 5%.

Diagnosis
Extension of the original zone of necrosis or reinfarction into a sepa-
rate myocardial zone can be a difficult diagnosis, especially within 
the first 24 hours after the index event. Diagnostic criteria have been 
established,168 but discrimination of a new myocardial infarction dis-
crete from the initial STEMI is often challenging because both cardiac 
markers may remain elevated as a result of the initial infarction and 
distinguishing changes of the normal evolution after the index infarc-
tion from those caused by recurrent infarction may not be possible 
on  the  ECG.  Recurrent  infarction  should  be  strongly  considered, 
however, when dynamic recurrent ST-segment elevation is noted on 
the ECG.

Pericarditis should also be considered in such patients. The pres-
ence  of  a  rub  and  lack  of  responsiveness  to  nitroglycerin  may  be 
useful in distinguishing pericardial discomfort, but doing so on clini-
cal grounds is frequently challenging, and diagnostic coronary angi-
ography  may  be  necessary  to  exclude  acute  native  vessel  or  stent 
thrombosis. The predominant angiographic predictors of reinfarction 
in patients undergoing primary PCI include a final coronary stenosis 
greater  than  30%,  post-PCI  coronary  dissection,  and  post-PCI  intra-
coronary thrombus.169

Prognosis
Regardless of whether postinfarction angina is persistent or limited, 
its presence is important because of the associated higher short-term 
morbidity  rate.  Reinfarction  is  linked  to  higher  rates  of  in-hospital 
complications  (congestive  heart  failure,  AV  block)  and  early  and 
long-term mortality.170 Presumably, the higher mortality rate is related 
to  the  larger  mass  of  myocardium,  the  function  of  which  becomes 
compromised.

Management
Patients  with  ST-segment  re-elevation  and  the  appropriate  clinical 
findings  should  be  referred  for  urgent  catheterization  and  PCI  (see 
Fig. 52-1) unless pericarditis or other post-MI complications are the 
cause; repeated fibrinolysis can be considered if PCI is not available. 
In patients believed to have recurrent ischemia in the absence of ST 
elevation  concerning  for  ongoing  injury  and  who  do  not  have  evi-
dence of hemodynamic compromise, an attempt should be made to 
control  symptoms  with  sublingual  or  intravenous  nitroglycerin  and 
intravenous  beta  blockade  to  slow  the  heart  rate  to  60  beats/min. 
When  hypotension,  congestive  heart  failure,  or  ventricular  arrhyth-
mias develop during recurrent ischemia, urgent catheterization and 
revascularization are indicated.

High-risk patients with STEMI who undergo fibrinolysis may benefit 
from a strategy of routine referral for catheterization and revascular-
ization (3 to 24 hours; see Fig. 52-13).72 Trials that compared primary 
PCI with PCI performed as soon as possible after a preparatory phar-
macologic regimen had been administered, however, have not shown 
such a facilitated PCI approach to be more effective than primary PCI, 
and  mortality  may  even  increase  because  of  excessive  bleeding  in 
the facilitated PCI group.1

Finally, with increasing use of PCI for the management of patients 
with STEMI, clinicians should be alert to the problem of stent throm-
bosis as a cause of recurrent ischemia. Stent thrombosis can occur 
acutely (hours to days after deployment of a stent) or in a more sub-
acute  fashion  (many  months  after  deployment  of  a  stent)  (see 
Chapter 55).

PericardialEffusionandPericarditis
(SeeChapter71)
Pericardial Effusion
Effusions  are  generally  detected  echocardiographically,  and  their 
incidence varies with technique, criteria, and laboratory expertise.171 
Effusions are more common in patients with anterior STEMI and with 
larger infarcts and when congestive failure is present. Most pericar-
dial effusions that occur following STEMI do not cause hemodynamic 
compromise.  The  reabsorption  rate  of  a  postinfarction  pericardial 
effusion  is  slow,  with  resolution  often  taking  several  months.  The 
presence of an effusion does not indicate that pericarditis is present; 
although  they  may  occur  together,  most  effusions  develop  without 
other  evidence  of  pericarditis.  When  tamponade  does  occur,  it  is 
usually caused by ventricular rupture or hemorrhagic pericarditis.

Pericarditis
Pericarditis can produce pain as early as the first day and as late as 
8 weeks after STEMI. The pain of pericarditis may be confused with 
that  resulting  from  postinfarction  angina,  recurrent  infarction,  or 
both. An important distinguishing feature is radiation of the pain to 
either trapezius ridge, a finding that is nearly pathognomonic of peri-
carditis and rarely seen with ischemic discomfort. Additionally, the 
discomfort of pericarditis usually becomes worse during a deep inspi-
ration, but it can be relieved or diminished when the patient sits up 
and leans forward.

Transmural MI, by definition, extends to the epicardial surface and 
can cause local pericardial inflammation. An acute fibrinous pericar-
ditis (pericarditis epistenocardica) occurs commonly after transmu-
ral infarction, but most patients do not report any symptoms from this 
process.  Although  transient  pericardial  friction  rubs  are  relatively 
common within the first 48 hours in patients with transmural infarc-
tion,  pain  or  electrocardiographic  changes  occur  much  less  often. 
The development of a pericardial rub, however, appears to correlate 
with a larger infarct and greater hemodynamic compromise.

Although  anticoagulation  clearly  increases  the  risk  for  hemor-
rhagic  pericarditis  early  after  STEMI,  this  complication  does  not 
occur  with  sufficient  frequency  during  heparinization  or  following 
fibrinolytic  therapy  to  warrant  absolute  prohibition  of  such  agents 
when a rub is present. Nevertheless, detection of a pericardial effu-
sion on echocardiography is usually an indication for discontinuation 
of anticoagulation. In patients in whom continuation or initiation of 

anticoagulant therapy is strongly indicated (e.g., during cardiac cath-
eterization), heightened monitoring of clotting parameters and obser-
vation  for  clinical  signs  of  possible  tamponade  are  necessary.  Late 
pericardial constriction caused by anticoagulant-induced hemoperi-
cardium has been reported.

Treatment of pericardial discomfort consists of aspirin, but usually 
in  doses  higher  than  prescribed  routinely  following  infarction
doses of 650 mg orally as often as every 4 hours may be necessary. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids should 
be  avoided  because  they  may  interfere  with  myocardial  scar 
formation.172

Dressler Syndrome
Also  known  as  postmyocardial  infarction  syndrome,  Dressler  syn-
drome usually occurs 1 to 8 weeks after infarction. Dressler cited an 
incidence of 3% to 4% of all patients with MI in 1957, but the incidence 
has decreased dramatically since that time. Clinically, patients with 
Dressler syndrome have malaise, fever, pericardial discomfort, leuko-
cytosis, an elevated sedimentation rate, and a pericardial effusion. At 
autopsy,  individuals  with  this  syndrome  usually  demonstrate  local-
ized  fibrinous  pericarditis  containing  polymorphonuclear  leuko-
cytes. The cause of this syndrome is not clearly established, although 
detection of antibodies to cardiac tissue has raised the notion of an 
immunopathologic  process.  Treatment  is  with  aspirin,  650 mg  as 
often as every 4 hours, and in large doses this is effective.172 Gluco-
corticosteroids and NSAIDs are best avoided in patients with Dressler 
syndrome  within  4  weeks  of  STEMI  because  of  their  potential  to 
impair infarct healing, cause ventricular rupture, and increase coro-
nary vascular resistance.172

VenousThrombosisand
PulmonaryEmbolism
Almost all peri-MI pulmonary emboli originate from thrombi in the 
veins of the lower extremities; much less commonly, they originate 
from mural thrombi overlying an area of right ventricular infarction. 
Bed rest and heart failure predispose to venous thrombosis and sub-
sequent  to  pulmonary  embolism,  and  both  these  conditions  occur 
commonly  in  patients  with  STEMI,  particularly  in  those  with  large 
infarcts. At a time when patients with STEMI were routinely subjected 
to  prolonged  periods  of  bed  rest,  significant  pulmonary  embolism 
was  found  in  more  than  20%  of  individuals  with  STEMI  examined  
at  autopsy,  and  massive  pulmonary  embolism  accounted  for  10%  
of deaths from MI. In contemporary practice, with early mobilization 
and  the  widespread  use  of  low-dose  anticoagulant  prophylaxis,  
especially  with  LMWH,  pulmonary  embolism  has  become  an  
uncommon cause of death in patients with STEMI. When pulmonary 
embolism does occur in patients with STEMI, management is gener-
ally  along  the  lines  described  for  patients  without  infarction  (see 
Chapter 73).

LeftVentricularAneurysm
The  term  left  ventricular  aneurysm  (often  termed  true  aneurysm)  is 
generally reserved for a discrete, dyskinetic area of the left ventricular 
wall  with  a  broad  neck  (to  differentiate  it  from  a  pseudoaneurysm 
caused  by  a  contained  myocardial  rupture).  Dyskinetic  or  akinetic 
areas of the left ventricle are far more common than true aneurysms 
after STEMI. True left ventricular aneurysms probably develop in less 
than 5% of all patients with STEMI.173 The wall of a true aneurysm is 
thinner than the wall of the rest of the left ventricle (see Fig. 52-29), 
and  it  is  usually  composed  of  fibrous  tissue,  as  well  as  necrotic 
muscle occasionally mixed with viable myocardium.

Pathogenesis
Aneurysm  formation  presumably  occurs  when 
intraventricular 
tension stretches the noncontracting infarcted heart muscle and thus 
produces  expansion  of  the  infarct,  a  relatively  weak,  thin  layer  of 
necrotic  muscle,  and  fibrous  tissue  that  bulges  with  each  cardiac 
contraction.  With  the  passage  of  time,  the  wall  of  the  aneurysm

becomes more densely fibrotic, but it continues to bulge with systole 
and  causes  some  of  the  left  ventricular  stroke  volume  during  each 
systole to be ineffective.

Total occlusion of a poorly collateralized left anterior descending 
coronary  artery  is  generally  associated  with  aneurysm  formation 
after  anterior  STEMI.  An  aneurysm  rarely  occurs  with  multivessel 
disease when either extensive collaterals or a nonoccluded left ante-
rior descending artery is present. Aneurysms usually range from 1 to 
8 cm in diameter. They occur approximately four times more often at 
the apex and in the anterior wall than in the inferoposterior wall. The 
overlying  pericardium  generally  adheres  densely  to  the  wall  of  the 
aneurysm, which may even become partially calcified after several 
years.  True  left  ventricular  aneurysms  (in  contrast  to  pseudoaneu-
rysms) rarely rupture soon after development. Late rupture, when the 
true  aneurysm  has  become  stabilized  by  the  formation  of  dense 
fibrous tissue in its wall, almost never occurs.

Diagnosis
The  presence  of  persistent  ST-segment  elevation  in  an  electrocardio-
graphic area of infarction, classically thought to suggest aneurysm for-
mation, indicates a large infarct with a regional wall motion abnormality 
but does not necessarily imply an aneurysm. The diagnosis of aneurysm 
is best made noninvasively by an echocardiographic study, by MRI, or 
by left ventriculography at the time of cardiac catheterization.

Prognosis and Treatment
A  left  ventricular  aneurysm  increases  the  risk  for  mortality,  even 
when compared with that in patients with a comparable left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction. Death in these patients is frequently sudden and 
presumably  related  to  the  relatively  high  incidence  of  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias that occur with aneurysms.174 With loss of shorten-
ing from the area of the aneurysm, the remainder of the ventricle may 
become hyperkinetic to compensate, but with relatively large aneu-
rysms, complete compensation is impossible. Stroke volume falls, or 
if  maintained,  it  is  at  the  expense  of  an  increase  in  end-diastolic 
volume, which in turn leads to increased wall tension and myocardial 
oxygen demand. Heart failure may ensue, and angina may appear or 
worsen.

Aggressive management of STEMI, including prompt reperfusion, 
may diminish the incidence of ventricular aneurysms. Surgical aneu-
rysmectomy  generally  succeeds  only  if  contractile  performance  in 
the nonaneurysmal portion of the left ventricle is relatively preserved. 
In such circumstances, when the operation is performed for worsen-
ing heart failure or angina, operative mortality is relatively low and 
clinical improvement can be expected. Several surgical techniques 
for  ventricular  reconstruction  have  been  developed  to  maintain  as 
normal a left ventricular shape as possible.175 Because of the risk for 
mural thrombosis and systemic embolization, long-term oral antico-
agulation with warfarin may be considered in patients with a residual 
left ventricular aneurysm after STEMI.

LeftVentricularThrombus
andArterialEmbolism
Endocardial inflammation and the relative stasis of blood during the 
acute phase of infarction probably provide a thrombogenic surface 
for clots to form in the left ventricle. With extensive transmural infarc-
tion  of  the  septum,  however,  mural  thrombi  may  overlie  infarcted 
myocardium  in  both  ventricles.  The  incidence  of  left  ventricular 
thrombus  formation  after  STEMI  appears  to  have  dropped  from 
approximately 20% to 5% with more aggressive use of antithrombotic 
strategies,  but  varying  imaging  techniques  will  influence  detection 
rates.176 Prospective studies have suggested that patients in whom a 
mural thrombus develops early (within 48 to 72 hours of infarction) 
have an extremely poor early prognosis, with a high rate of mortality 
from  the  complications  of  a  large  infarction  (shock,  reinfarction, 
rupture,  and  ventricular  tachyarrhythmia),  rather  than  emboli  from 
the left ventricular thrombus.

Even though a mural thrombus adheres to the endocardium overly-
ing the infarcted myocardium, superficial portions of it can become 

1137

detached and produce systemic arterial emboli. Although estimates 
vary  because  of  patient  selection,  approximately  10%  of  mural 
thrombi  result  in  systemic  embolization.  Echocardiographically 
detectable features suggesting that a given thrombus is more likely to 
embolize include increased mobility and protrusion into the ventricu-
lar chamber, visualization on multiple views, and contiguous zones 
of  akinesis  and  hyperkinesis.  MRI  techniques  can  also  be  used  to 
characterize  left  ventricular  thrombi  and  assist  in  prediction  of  the 
risk for embolism.176

Management
Data  from  previous  trials  with  limited  sample  sizes  suggested  that 
anticoagulation  (intravenous  heparin  or  high-dose  subcutaneous 
heparin) reduces the development of left ventricular thrombi by 50%, 
but because of the low event rate, demonstrating a reduction in the 
incidence  of  systemic  embolism  was  not  possible.  Fibrinolysis 
reduces  the  rate  of  thrombus  formation  and  the  character  of  the 
thrombi so that they are less protuberant. Of note, however, the data 
from  fibrinolytic  trials  are  difficult  to  interpret  because  of  the  con-
founding effect of antithrombotic therapy with heparin. Recommen-
dations  for  anticoagulation  vary  considerably,  and  fibrinolysis  has 
precipitated  fatal  embolization.  Moreover,  few  data  from  the  era  
of dual antiplatelet therapy after primary PCI are available to make 
decisions. Nevertheless, anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months with war-
farin  is  reasonable  for  many  patients  with  demonstrable  mural 
thrombi.  For  patients  with  STEMI  and  anterior  apical  akinesis  or 
severe dyskinesis, a limited course of anticoagulant therapy may also 
be considered.1

CONVALESCENCE,DISCHARGE,AND
POSTMYOCARDIALINFARCTIONCARE

The transition to outpatient care after STEMI is a critical one. Post-
hospital  systems  of  care  designed  to  reduce  hospital  readmissions 
should be used to facilitate coordinated, evidence-based outpatient 
care for all patients with STEMI.1,177

Timing of Hospital Discharge
In  practice,  the  timing  of  discharge  from  the  hospital  is  variable. 
Patients  with  STEMI  are  at  risk  for  late  in-hospital  mortality  from 
recurrent  ischemia  or  infarction,  hemodynamically  significant  ven-
tricular arrhythmias, and severe congestive heart failure. Risk indica-
tors for mortality in the hospital include significant congestive heart 
failure as evidenced by persistent sinus tachycardia and pulmonary 
congestion,  recurrent  VT  and  VF,  new  atrial  fibrillation  or  flutter, 
intraventricular conduction delays or heart block, anterior location 
of  infarction,  and  recurrent  episodes  of  angina  with  marked 
ST-segment abnormalities at low activity levels (see the section Risk 
Stratification after ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction).

Aggressive  reperfusion  protocols  with  PCI  or  fibrinolytics  can 
reduce  the  length  of  hospital  stay  without  compromising  mortality 
after discharge.178,179 In patients believed to have successfully under-
gone reperfusion, the absence of early sustained ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias, hypotension, or heart failure, coupled with a well-preserved 
left ventricular ejection fraction, predicts a low risk for late complica-
tions in the hospital. Such patients appear to be suitable candidates 
for discharge from the hospital in less than 5 days from the onset of 
symptoms.179 Most complications that would preclude early discharge 
occur within the first 3 days of admission; therefore patients suitable 
for early discharge can be identified early during the hospitalization. 
Several  controlled  trials  and  many  uncontrolled  trials  of  early  dis-
charge after STEMI have failed to show any increase in risk in patients 
appropriately selected for early discharge.178,179

Following STEMI, patients are often eager for information, anxious, 
in  need  of  reassurance,  confused  by  misinformation  and  previous 
impressions, and capable of counterproductive denial. The hospital-
ization  after  STEMI  provides  ample  opportunities  to  begin  the  
rehabilitation process. The decision regarding timing of discharge in

patients  with  uncomplicated  STEMI  should  take  into  account  the 
patients psychological state after STEMI, the adequacy of dose titra-
tion  for  essential  drugs  such  as  beta  blockers  and  inhibitors  of  the 
RAAS, and the availability and timing of follow-up with visiting nurses 
and the patients primary care physician. In patients who have expe-
rienced  a  complication,  discharge  is  deferred  until  their  condition 
has  been  stable  for  several  days  and  it  is  clear  that  they  have 
responded appropriately to any interventions.

Counseling
Before  discharge  from  the  hospital,  all  patients  should  receive 
detailed instruction concerning physical activity. Initially, this should 
consist of walking at home but avoidance of isometric exercise such 
as lifting. In addition, the patient should be given fresh nitroglycerin 
tablets and be instructed in their use (see Chapter 54) and should 
receive  instructions  for  any  other  medications  prescribed.  Graded 
resumption  of  activity  should  be  encouraged,  ideally  as  part  of  a 
monitored cardiac rehabilitation program (see Chapters 47 and 79). 
Many approaches have been used, ranging from formal rigid guide-
lines to general advice advocating moderation and avoidance of any 
activity that evokes symptoms. Sexual counseling, often overlooked 
during recovery from STEMI, should be included in the educational 
process.180  In  addition,  physicians  should  explicitly  discuss  the  risk 
associated with continued smoking and offer assistance in cessation, 
along with nicotine replacement therapy in appropriate patients.1,181
Some evidence indicates that behavioral alteration is possible after 
recovery  from  STEMI  and  that  this  may  improve  the  prognosis. 
Patients  with  STEMI  should  be  referred  to  a  postdischarge  cardiac 
rehabilitation program with supervised physical exercise and an edu-
cational  component.182  Given  the  relationship  between  depression 
and STEMI, psychosocial intervention programs can decrease symp-
toms  of  depression  and  are  a  useful  adjunct  to  standard  cardiac 
rehabilitation programs after STEMI183 (see Chapters 47 and 86).

RiskStratificationafterST-Elevation
MyocardialInfarction
The  process  of  risk  stratification  following  STEMI  occurs  in  several 
stages:  initial  findings,  in-hospital  course  (CCU,  intermediate  care 
unit), and at the time of hospital discharge. The tools used to form 
an  integrated  and  dynamic  assessment  of  the  patient  consist  of  
baseline  demographic  information;  serial  ECGs  and  serum  and 
plasma cardiac biomarker measurements; hemodynamic monitoring 
data; a variety of noninvasive tests; and if performed, the findings at 
cardiac  catheterization.  These  findings,  integrated  with  the  occur-
rence of in-hospital complications, can provide information regard-
ing survival.

Initial Findings
Certain demographic and historical factors portend a worse progno-
sis in patients with STEMI, including age older than 65 years, a history 
of diabetes mellitus, previous angina pectoris, and previous MI (see 
Fig. 52-8). Diabetes mellitus, in particular, appears to confer a more 
than 40% increase in adjusted risk for death by 30 days (see Chapter 
61).184  Surviving  diabetic  patients  also  experience  a  more  compli-
cated post-MI course, including a greater incidence of postinfarction 
angina,  infarct  extension,  and  heart  failure.  These  higher  rates  of 
complications  probably  relate  to  the  extensive  accelerated  athero-
sclerosis and higher risk for thrombosis and heart failure associated 
with diabetes mellitus.

In addition to playing a central role in the decision pathway for the 
management of patients with ACSs based on the presence or absence 
of ST-segment elevation, the 12-lead ECG carries important prognos-
tic information.63 Mortality is greater in patients experiencing anterior 
wall STEMI than in those with inferior STEMI, even when corrected 
for infarct size. Patients with right ventricular infarction complicating 
inferior infarction, as suggested by ST-segment elevation in V4R, have 
greater mortality rate than do patients sustaining an inferior infarc-
tion  without  right  ventricular  involvement.  Patients  with  multiple 
leads showing ST elevation and a high sum of ST-segment elevation 

have an increased mortality rate, especially if their infarct is anterior 
in  location.  Patients  whose  ECGs  demonstrate  persistent  advanced 
heart block (e.g., type II second-degree or third-degree AV block) or 
new intraventricular conduction abnormalities (bifascicular or trifas-
cicular)  in  the  course  of  STEMI  have  a  worse  prognosis  than  do 
patients without these abnormalities. The influence of high degrees 
of heart block has particular importance in patients with right ven-
tricular infarction because such patients have a markedly increased 
mortality risk.63 Other electrocardiographic findings that augur poorly 
are  persistent  horizontal  or  downsloping  ST-segment  depression,  Q 
waves  in  multiple  leads,  evidence  of  right  ventricular  infarction 
accompanying inferior infarction, ST-segment depression in anterior 
leads in patients with inferior infarction, and atrial arrhythmias (espe-
cially atrial fibrillation).

Several  validated  clinical  risk  stratification  tools  may  be  used  at 
initial evaluation to assess the short- and long-term risk for death after 
MI.63  In  addition  to  the  patients  age  and  historical  factors  such  as 
diabetes  and  previous  MI,  clinical  signs  of  heart  failure,  including 
tachycardia and hypotension, are common in many of these clinical 
risk assessment scores.

Hospital Course
Hospital mortality from STEMI depends directly on the severity of left 
ventricular dysfunction. Risk stratification via physical findings, esti-
mation of infarct size, and in appropriate patients, invasive hemody-
namic  monitoring  provides  an  assessment  of  the  likelihood  of  a 
complicated hospital course and may also identify important abnor-
malities,  such  as  hemodynamically  significant  mitral  regurgitation, 
that convey an adverse long-term prognosis (see Table 52-9). In par-
ticular, the development of heart failure after MI entails a higher risk 
for  sudden  cardiac  death.185  Recurrent  infarction  and  new  stroke 
during hospitalization for STEMI also, not surprisingly, confer a higher 
risk for death.

Assessment at Hospital Discharge
Both short- and long-term survival after STEMI depend on three major 
factors: resting left ventricular function, residual potentially ischemic 
myocardium,  and  susceptibility  to  serious  ventricular  arrhythmias. 
The  most  important  of  these  factors  is  the  state  of  left  ventricular 
function (see Fig. 52-23).63 The second most important factor is how 
the  severity  and  extent  of  the  obstructive  lesions  in  the  coronary 
vascular bed perfusing residual viable myocardium affect the risk for 
recurrent infarction, additional myocardial damage, and serious ven-
tricular arrhythmias. Thus survival is related to the quantity of myo-
cardium  that  has  become  necrotic  and  the  quantity  at  risk  of 
becoming necrotic. At one end of the spectrum, the prognosis is best 
for patients with normal intrinsic coronary vessels whose completed 
infarction constitutes a small fraction (5%) of the left ventricle as a 
consequence of a coronary embolus and who have no jeopardized 
myocardium. At the other extreme are patients with a massive infarct 
and left ventricular failure whose residual viable myocardium is per-
fused by markedly obstructed vessels. Progression of atherosclerosis 
or lowering of perfusion pressure in these vessels impairs the func-
tion and viability of the residual myocardium on which left ventricu-
lar function depends. Revascularization may reduce the threat to the 
jeopardized myocardium even in such patients. The third risk factor, 
susceptibility  to  serious  arrhythmias,  is  reflected  in  ventricular 
ectopic activity and other indicators of electrical instability, such as 
reduced heart rate variability or baroreflex sensitivity and abnormal 
findings on a signal-averaged ECG.63 All these factors identify patients 
at increased risk for death.

Assessment of Left Ventricular Function
The left ventricular ejection fraction may be the most easily assessed 
measurement  of  left  ventricular  function  and  is  extremely  useful  
for  risk  stratification  (see  Fig.  52-23).  However,  imaging  of  the  
left ventricle at rest may not adequately distinguish among infarcted, 
irreversibly  damaged,  and  stunned  or  hibernating  myocardium.  
To  circumvent  this  difficulty,  various  techniques  have  been  investi-
gated to assess the extent of residual viable myocardiumincluding

exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography, stress radionu-
clide ventricular angiography, perfusion imaging in conjunction with 
pharmacologic stress, positron emission tomography, and gadolinium-
enhanced MRI.186,187 All these techniques can be performed safely in 
postinfarction  patients.  Because  no  study  has  clearly  shown  one 
imaging modality to be superior to the others, clinicians should be 
guided  in  their  selection  of  ventricular  imaging  technique  by  the 
availability and level of expertise with a given modality at their local 
institution.188

Assessment of Myocardial Ischemia
Because  of  the  adverse  consequences  of  recurrent  MI  after  STEMI, 
assessing a patients risk for future ischemia and infarction is impor-
tant. Predischarge noninvasive testing for ischemia provides valuable 
information about the presence of residual ischemia in patients who 
have not undergone coronary angiography during the initial manage-
ment  of  STEMI  and  may  also  be  useful  in  assessing  the  functional 
significance  of  any  angiographically  significant  coronary  stenoses 
identified at angiography but not revascularized (see Table 52-6). In 
the latter case, stress imaging to localize ischemia may be useful.

EXERCISE TESTING.  An exercise test also offers an opportunity to 
formulate  a  more  precise  exercise  prescription  and  helps  boost 
patients  confidence  in  their  ability  to  conduct  their  daily  activities 
after discharge. Patients who are unable to exercise can be evaluated 
via a pharmacologic stress protocol with echocardiography or perfu-
sion imaging. Treadmill exercise testing after STEMI has traditionally 
used  a  submaximal  protocol  that  requires  the  patient  to  exercise  
until symptoms of angina appear, electrocardiographic evidence of 
ischemia is seen, or a target workload (5 metabolic equivalents) has 
been  reached,  whichever  comes  first  (see  Chapter  47).  Symptom-
limited  exercise  tests  can  be  performed  safely  before  discharge  in 
patients  with  an  uncomplicated  course  after  infarction.  Variables 
derived from exercise tests after STEMI that have been evaluated for 
their ability to predict the occurrence of death or recurrent nonfatal 
infarction  include  the  development  and  magnitude  of  ST-segment 
depression,  the  development  of  angina,  exercise  capacity,  and  the 
systolic blood pressure response during exercise.63

Assessment for Electrical Instability
After  STEMI,  patients  are  at  greatest  risk  for  the  development  of 
sudden cardiac death caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias 
in the first 1 to 2 years.63 Multiple techniques have been proposed to 
stratify patients into those who are at increased risk for sudden death 
following  STEMI:  measurement  of  QT  dispersion  (variability  in  QT 
intervals between ECG leads), ambulatory ECGs for detection of ven-
tricular arrhythmias (Holter monitoring), invasive electrophysiologic 
testing,  recording  of  a  signal-averaged  ECG  (a  measure  of  delayed, 
fragmented  conduction  in  the  infarct  zone),  and  measurement  of 
heart rate variability (beat-to-beat variability in R-R intervals) or baro-
reflex sensitivity (slope of a line relating beat-to-beat change in the 
sinus  rate  in  response  to  alteration  of  blood  pressure),  but  none  
of  these  approaches  have  proved  sufficiently  useful  for  routine 
practice.63

Despite the increased risk for arrhythmic events following STEMI 
in patients who are found to have abnormal results on one or more 
of  the  noninvasive  tests  described  earlier,  several  points  should  be 
emphasized. The low positive predictive value (<30%) of the nonin-
vasive  screening  tests  limits  their  usefulness  when  viewed  in  isola-
tion. Although the predictive value of screening tests can be improved 
by combining several of them together, the therapeutic implications 
of  an  increased  risk  profile  for  arrhythmic  events  have  not  been 
established. The reductions in mortality achievable with the general 
use  of  beta  blockers,  ACE  inhibitors,  aspirin,  and  revascularization 
when appropriate after infarction, coupled with concerns about the 
efficacy and safety of antiarrhythmic drugs and the cost of implanted 
defibrillators,  leave  considerable  uncertainty  about  the  therapeutic 
implications  of  an  abnormal  noninvasive  test  result  for  electrical 
instability  in  an  asymptomatic  patient.  Action  by  clinicians  on  the 
results of an abnormal finding in asymptomatic patients should await 
additional  data  on  patient  outcomes.  Management  of  patients  with 

1139

sustained, hemodynamically compromising arrhythmias is discussed 
in Chapters 35 through 38.

Prophylactic Antiarrhythmic Therapy
Although  antiarrhythmic  therapy  can  control  atrial  and  ventricular 
arrhythmias effectively in many patients, routine use of prophylactic 
antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy,  with  the  exception  of  beta  blockers, 
does not improve outcome and, with some agents, increases the risk 
for death.1 The most notable postinfarction trial in this area was CAST 
(Cardiac  Arrhythmia  Suppression  Trial),  which  tested  whether 
encainide,  flecainide,  or  moricizine  for  suppression  of  ventricular 
arrhythmias  detected  on  ambulatory  electrocardiographic  monitor-
ing would reduce the risk for cardiac arrest and death; however, CAST 
was  stopped  prematurely  because  of  increased  mortality  in  the  
active treatment groups. The SWORD (Survival With ORal D-sotalol) 
trial was similarly stopped prematurely because of increased mortal-
ity  in  the  active  treatment  group.  In  contrast,  CAMIAT  (Canadian 
Amiodarone  Myocardial  Infarction  Trial)  showed  that  amiodarone 
reduces  the  frequency  of  ventricular  premature  depolarization  in 
patients  with  recent  MI  and  that  this  reduction  correlated  with  
lowering of arrhythmic death or resuscitation from VF. However, 42% 
of  patients  discontinued  use  of  amiodarone  during  maintenance 
therapy  in  CAMIAT  because  of  intolerable  side  effects.  EMIAT  
(European Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial) showed a reduc-
tion  in  arrhythmic  death  after  MI  in  patients  with  depressed  left 
ventricular  function,  but  total  mortality  and  other  cardiovascular-
related mortality did not decrease.

The routine use of antiarrhythmic agents (including amiodarone) 
therefore  cannot  be  recommended.  Although  trials  that  included 
post-STEMI patients in the study population have shown significant 
reductions in mortality in those randomly assigned to ICD implanta-
tion  versus  conventional  medical  therapy  (see  Chapter  36),  early 
implantation of an ICD in the first few weeks after MI has not shown 
benefit.189  Routine  risk  stratification  to  guide  ICD  placement  early 
after STEMI is therefore not recommended; reassessment of left ven-
tricular function 40 days or longer after STEMI may be used to guide 
consideration  of  an  ICD  for  primary  prevention  of  sudden  cardiac 
death (Fig. 52-34).189,190 Trials of strategies for prevention and treat-
ment of arrhythmias, including the use of wearable external defibril-
lators,191 during the early period after STEMI are ongoing.

SecondaryPreventionofAcuteMyocardial
Infarction(SeeChapters42and45)
Patients who survive the initial course of STEMI still have consider-
able  risk  for  recurrent  events,  thus  rendering  efforts  imperative  to 
reduce this risk.

Cardiac Rehabilitation
Contemporary  exercise-based  cardiac  rehabilitation  after  STEMI  is 
aimed at increasing functional capacity, reducing disability, improv-
ing  quality  of  life,  modifying  coronary  risk  factors,  and  reducing 
morbidity  and  mortality  rates.192-194  The  key  components  of  cardiac 
rehabilitation  include  patient  assessment;  ongoing  medical  surveil-
lance;  nutritional  counseling;  management  of  hypertension,  lipids, 
and  diabetes  mellitus;  cessation  of  smoking;  psychosocial  counsel-
ing;  physical  activity  counseling;  exercise  training;  and  pharmaco-
logic treatment, as appropriate.195 When compared with usual care, 
cardiac rehabilitation is associated with lower total and cardiac mor-
tality,  but  despite  these  outcomes,  cardiac  rehabilitation  services 
remain vastly underused.1

Lifestyle Modification
Efforts  to  improve  survival  and  quality  of  life  after  MI  that  relate  to 
lifestyle modification of known risk factors are considered in Chapter 
42. Of these, cessation of smoking and control of hypertension are 
probably the most important. Use of hospital-based smoking cessa-
tion  programs  and  referral  to  cardiac  rehabilitation  programs  have 
led to successful smoking cessation.196

Depression (See Chapter 86)
Physicians caring for patients following STEMI need to be sensitive 
to the prevalence of major depression after infarction.197 This problem 
is  independently  associated  with  higher  risk  for  death.  In  addition, 
lack  of  an  emotionally  supportive  network  in  the  patients  environ-
ment after discharge is associated with an increased risk for recurrent 
cardiac events. The precise mechanisms relating depression and lack 
of social support to a worse prognosis after STEMI are not clear, but 
one possibility is lack of adherence to prescribed treatments, a behav-
ior  that  has  been  associated  with  increased  risk  for  mortality  after 
infarction. Therefore a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program 
that  includes  primary  health  care  personnel  who  counsel  patients 
and  make  home  visits  can  reduce  the  rate  of  rehospitalization  for 
recurrent ischemia and infarction.198

FIGURE 52-34  A, DINAMIT trial and algorithm for implantation of an ICD in 
patients  with  STEMI  but  without  VF  or  sustained  VT  more  than  48  hours  after 
STEMI. DINAMIT was a randomized, open-label study comparing ICD with no ICD 
therapy  6  to  40  days  after  an  MI  in  674  patients  who  also  had  a  left  ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less and impaired cardiac autonomic function. 
The study concluded that ICD therapy was associated with a reduction in the rate 
of  death  from  arrhythmias  but  that  this  advantage  was  offset  by  an  increase  in 
deaths from other causes. B, The appropriate management path is based on mea-
surement  of  LVEF;  measurements  obtained  3  days  or  less  after  STEMI  should  be 
repeated before proceeding with the algorithm. Patients with an LVEF of less than 
30% to 40% at least 40 days after STEMI are referred for insertion of an ICD if 
they are in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III. Patients with a more 
depressed LVEF of less than 30% to 35% are referred for ICD implantation even if 
they  are  NYHA  class  I  because  of  their  increased  risk  for  sudden  cardiac  death. 
Patients  with  preserved  left  ventricular  function  (LVEF >  40%)  do  not  receive  an 
ICD and are treated with medical therapy after STEMI. (A, From Hohnloser SH, Kuck

Modification of Lipid Profile (See Chapters 42 and 45)
A target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/
dL  with  an  optimal  target  of  less  than  70 mg/dL  has  been  recom-
mended  in  patients  with  clinically  evident  CAD.199  High-intensity 
statin  therapy  should  be  initiated  or  continued  in  all  patients  with 
STEMI and no contraindications to its use.1 Obtaining a lipid profile 
on admission is reasonable in all patients admitted with acute infarc-
tion. Total cholesterol levels may fall 24 to 48 hours after infarction.

Antiplatelet Agents (See also Chapter 82)
On the basis of compelling data from the Antiplatelet Trialists Col-
laboration  of  a  22%  reduction  in  the  risk  for  recurrent  infarction, 
stroke, or vascular death in high-risk vascular patients receiving pro-
longed antiplatelet therapy, in the absence of true aspirin allergy all 
patients  with  STEMI  should  receive  75  to  325 mg  of  aspirin  daily 
indefinitely,  with  81 mg  being  the  preferred  maintenance  dose.1,154 
Additional  benefits  of  long-term  aspirin  therapy  that  can  accrue  in 
patients with STEMI include an increased likelihood of patency of the 
infarct  artery  and  smaller  infarcts  if  MI  recurs.  Patients  with  true 
aspirin  allergy  can  be  treated  with  clopidogrel  (75 mg  once  daily)  
on  the  basis  of  experience  in  patients  with  unstable  angina/non
ST-segment  elevation  MI.  In  the  absence  of  contraindications,  all 
patients after STEMI should receive a platelet inhibitor in addition to 
aspirin  for  12  months  according  to  one  of  the  following  regimens: 
clopidogrel  (75 mg/day)  in  patients  with  STEMI  treated  with  or 
without  PCI,  prasugrel  (10 mg/day)  in  patients  treated  with  PCI,  or 
ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) in patients to be treated with PCI.1 In 
patients treated with PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor have been found 
to be superior to clopidogrel and are recommended as preferred in 
some  professional  guidelines.4  However,  in  some  practice  environ-
ments, economic or formulary barriers may render access to prasug-
rel  or  ticagrelor  difficult  for  some  patients.  Given  the  critical 
importance of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients who have received 
drug-eluting stents, access to a P2Y12 inhibitor must be ensured. The 
twice-daily  dosing  regimen  for  ticagrelor  should  be  considered  for 
patients  with  concern  regarding  adherence  to  this  regimen.  The 
optimum duration of treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy remains 
uncertain. Nonetheless, its benefit has continued after 30 days, and 
for now, a P2Y12 inhibitor along with aspirin should be administered 
to most patients for at least 1 year after STEMI, with aspirin treatment 
being maintained indefinitely.1

Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
See  Inhibition  of  the  Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone  System  in  the 
section Pharmacologic Therapy. To prevent late remodeling of the left 
ventricle and to decrease the likelihood of recurrent ischemic events, 
we advocate indefinite therapy with an ACE inhibitor in patients with 
heart  failure,  a  moderate  decrease  in  global  ejection  fraction,  or  a 
large  regional  wall  motion  abnormality,  even  in  the  presence  of  a 
normal global ejection fraction. Other candidates for long-term man-
agement with ACE inhibitors or ARBs are discussed in Chapter 54.

Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents
Meta-analyses of trials from the prethrombolytic era involving more 
than 24,000 patients who received beta blockers in the convalescent 
phase of STEMI have shown a 23% reduction in long-term mortality. 
In  most  patients  who  have  beta  blockade  initiated  during  the  
convalescent phase of STEMI, the reduction in long-term mortality is 
probably caused by the combination of an antiarrhythmic effect (pre-
vention of sudden death) and prevention of reinfarction.

Given the well-documented benefits of therapy with a beta blocker, 
it is disturbing that this form of treatment continues to be underused, 
especially  in  high-risk  groups  such  as  older  adults.  Patients  with  a 
relative  contraindication  to  beta  blockers  (e.g.,  bradyarrhythmias) 
should  undergo  a  monitored  trial  of  therapy  in  the  hospital.  The 
dosage should be sufficient to blunt the heart rate response to stress 
or exercise. Much of the impact of beta blockers in preventing mortal-
ity  occurs  in  the  first  weeks;  consequently,  treatment  should  com-
mence as soon as possible. Programs that provide physician feedback 
to improve adherence to guidelines should be used.

1141

Some  controversy  exists  regarding  how  long  patients  should  be 
treated. The collective data from five trials that provided information 
on  long-term  follow-up  of  patients  treated  with  beta  blockers  after 
infarction suggest that therapy should be continued for at least 2 to 
3 years. At that time, if the beta blocker is well tolerated and there is 
no reason to discontinue therapy, such therapy probably should be 
continued in most patients (see Chapter 54).

Nitrates
Although  these  agents  are  suitable  for  the  management  of  specific 
conditions  after  STEMI  (such  as  recurrent  angina)  or  as  part  of  a 
treatment  regimen  for  congestive  heart  failure,  little  evidence  indi-
cates that they reduce mortality over the long term when prescribed 
on a routine basis to all patients with infarction.

Anticoagulants
After several decades of evaluation, the weight of evidence now sug-
gests  that  anticoagulants  have  a  favorable  effect  on  late  mortality, 
stroke,  and  reinfarction  in  patients  hospitalized  with  STEMI  (Fig. 
52-35).  Given  the  complexities  of  combining  long-term  warfarin 
therapy with antiplatelet therapy, clinicians must weigh the need for 
warfarin  based  on  established  indications  for  anticoagulation,  the 
use of other antithrombotic therapies, and the risk for bleeding.83

At least three theoretical reasons exist for anticipating that antico-
agulants might be beneficial in the long-term management of patients 
after  STEMI.  (1)  Because  the  coronary  occlusion  responsible  for 
STEMI  is  often  caused  by  a  thrombus,  anticoagulants  might  be 
expected to halt progression, slow progression, or prevent the devel-
opment  of  new  thrombi  elsewhere  in  the  coronary  arterial  tree;  
(2)  anticoagulants  might  be  expected  to  diminish  the  formation  of 
mural thrombi and resultant systemic embolization; and (3) antico-
agulants might be expected to reduce the incidence of venous throm-
bosis and pulmonary embolization.

Alternative  oral  anticoagulants  that  have  the  advantage  of  more 
predictable  anticoagulation  with  stable  oral  dosing,  such  as  the  
oral factor Xa inhibitors, have undergone evaluation in patients with 
ACSs, including STEMI patients treated with background antiplatelet 
therapies. ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 (Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovas-
cular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects with Acute 
Coronary  SyndromeThrombolysis  in  Myocardial  Infarction)  tested 
two  low  doses  of  the  oral  factor  Xa  inhibitor  rivaroxaban  versus 
placebo. Rivaroxaban at doses of both 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily sig-
nificantly reduced cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in comparison 
to  placebo  (8.9%  versus  10.7%;  P =  0.008;  Fig.  52-35).200  Both  doses 
also reduced stent thrombosis. The group receiving the 2.5-mg dose 
demonstrated  a  significant  reduction  in  cardiovascular  mortality

in the primary endpoint occurred.

(2.7%  versus  4.1%;  P =  0.002)  when  compared  with  placebo,  which 
was not seen with 5 mg. Rivaroxaban resulted in an increase in major 
bleeding (2.1% versus 0.6%; P < 0.001) without a significant increase 
in fatal bleeding.

Despite similar findings in the ACS phase II studies with rivaroxa-
ban (ATLAS ACS-TIMI 46)201 and with another oral factor Xa inhibitor, 
apixaban  (APPRAISE  [Apixaban  for  Prevention  of  Acute  Ischemic 
Events]),202  the  phase  III  APPRAISE-2  study,  which  tested  apixaban 
versus  placebo  in  patients  following  an  ACS,  was  terminated  early 
because  of  an  increase  in  major  bleeding  without  a  significant 
improvement in efficacy.203 The divergent results of the ATLAS ACS 
2-TIMI 51 and APPRAISE-2 studies may be related to the baseline risk 
of the patients in that APPRAISE-2 enrolled older patients with more 
comorbid  conditions  than  the  other  three  trials  did.  Consequently, 
these patients may have experienced competing risks and diseases 
not  necessarily  modified  by  anticoagulant  therapy.  Additionally, 
APPRAISE-2  included  patients  with  a  previous  stroke  or  transient 
ischemic attack, and recent studies have illustrated that this group of 
patients  may  not  benefit  from  further  intensification  of  antithrom-
botic therapy. Finally, APPRAISE-2 studied higher degrees of antico-
agulation than ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 did.

Calcium Channel Antagonists
At present we do not recommend the routine use of calcium antago-
nists for secondary prevention of infarction. A possible exception is 
a  patient  who  cannot  tolerate  a  beta  blocker  because  of  adverse 
effects on bronchospastic lung disease but who has well-preserved 
left ventricular function; such patients may be candidates for a rate-
slowing calcium antagonist such as diltiazem or verapamil.

Given  the  increased  risk  for  atherothrombosis  related  to  the  index 
STEMI event, the desire not to interfere with the beneficial pharma-
cologic  actions  of  low-dose  aspirin  after  STEMI,  and  reports  of 
increased  mortality  and  reinfarction  when  they  are  used  after  MI, 
clinicians  should  avoid  prescribing  NSAIDs  to  patients  recovering 
from  STEMI.1  If  NSAIDs  must  be  prescribed  for  relief  of  pain,  the 
lowest  dose  required  to  control  symptoms  should  be  administered 
for the shortest time required.208

FUTUREDIRECTIONSAND
EMERGINGTHERAPIES

Although the case fatality of patients with STEMI has declined sub-
stantially,  considerable  opportunities  for  improvement  remain.  Of 
these, we emphasize four major directions: (1) evidence-based devel-
opment of systems for care of patients with STEMI, (2) mitigation of 
reperfusion  injury  and  impaired  myocardial  tissue  perfusion,  (3) 
management of cardiogenic shock after STEMI, and (4) amelioration 
of the adverse remodeling.

The  widespread  adoption  of  regional  systems  of  care  for  patients 
with  STEMI  across  diverse  areas  has  remained  challenging,  and  
inappropriate delays to initiation of reperfusion therapy are regrettably 
common. Comparative effectiveness research is needed to directly test 
the  implementation  of  prehospital  EMS  protocols,  management  of 
patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, practical triage, and trans-
fer algorithms to get patients to expert PCI services rapidly.10,11,80,209

Although  PCI  usually  restores  flow  through  epicardial  arteries, 
many patients do not achieve adequate nutrient flow at the myocardial 
level  in  the  infarct  zone  because  of  impaired  microvascular  flow  
(Fig.  52-36;  see  also  Fig.  52-5).52  Despite  effective  restoration  of 

Hormone Therapy (See also

PCI and pharmacologic reperfusion has proven challenging. The ben-
efits  of  thrombus  aspiration  before  stenting  in  patients  undergoing 
primary PCI appear to be mitigated in part by improving microvascular 
perfusion; however, the proportion of patients with impaired micro-
vascular flow because of distal embolization and abnormal vasomotor 
regulation in the distal vessels remains substantial. These abnormali-
ties in vasomotor function are derived in part from the intense release 
of oxidative species and inflammatory cytokines that occurs during 
reperfusion  of  the  necrotic  area.  This  consequence  of  successful 
reperfusion, which underlies the phenomenon of reperfusion injury, 
can  also  lead  to  extension  of  myocardial  injury  beyond  the  initial 
ischemic  zone.  To  date,  multiple  candidate  interventions  to  reduce 
reperfusion injury that have appeared promising in initial studies have 
failed in definitive randomized trials.36 Amelioration of the reperfusion 
injury that contributes to long-term myocardial dysfunction remains 
an unmet clinical need.39,122 Therefore processes that  contribute  to 
both  microvascular  obstruction210  and  reperfu sion injury are poten-
tial therapeutic targets that merit ongoing investigation.

Even if reperfusion is achieved in timely fashion and microvascular 
obstruction is minimized, patients with STEMI inevitably loose some 
myocytes. When ventricular failure or severe mechanical disruption 
results,  cardiogenic  shock  may  ensue.  Mortality  from  cardiogenic 
shock  remains  in  excess  of  40%.  Improvement  in  the  outcomes  of 
patients in whom shock develops after STEMI remains a vexing clini-
cal challenge.131 The disappointing results of recent trials of percuta-
neous mechanical support have challenged commonly held clinical 
assumptions.142,211,212  Novel  therapies  and  strategies  for  the  manage-
ment  of  shock  are  a  critical  area  for  substantial  investment  in 
research.132

In addition to the early risk for ventricular failure because of acute 
myocardial  injury,  secondary  damage  to  the  left  ventricle  can  also 

occur  in  the  long  term  as  a  result  of  ventricular  remodeling  after 
STEMI.123,213  Treatments  to  minimize  ventricular  remodeling  include 
the  standard  approaches  to  disruption  of  the  RAAS  and  potential  
new  therapies  such  as  renin  inhibition,  reducing  the  amount  of 
central  nervous  system  generation  of  aldosterone,  enhancing  the 
synthesis  of  endothelial  nitric  oxide  synthase,  modulating  beta-
adrenergic  signaling,  and  minimizing  the  processes  that  lead  to 
cardiac apoptosis.123,213 Novel approaches using biologic and mechan-
ical 
improve  ventricular  structure  are  under 
investigation.214-216  Moreover,  myocytes  are  capable  of  entering 
the  cell  cycle  and  dividing  (see  Chapter  30).217  The  burgeoning 
field  of  cardiac  regenerative  medicine  holds  promise  to  support  
amelioration  of  the  adverse  ventricular  remodeling  by  using  
both  endogenous  and  exogenous  sources  of  cells  that  give  rise  to 
myocytes (Fig. 52-37).218

GUIDELINES
Managementof
PatientswithST-Elevation
MyocardialInfarction
Stephen D. Wiviott

The  American  College  of  Cardiology  Foundation/American  Heart 
Association  (ACCF/AHA)  updated  guidelines  for  the  diagnosis  and 
management  of  patients  with  ST-elevation  myocardial  infarction 
(STEMI) in 2013.1 As with other ACCF/AHA guidelines, indications for 
interventions are classified into the following four groups:
Class IFor generally accepted indications
Class IIaWhen indications are controversial but the weight of evi-

dence is supportive

Class IIbWhen usefulness or efficacy is less well established
Class  IIIWhen  there  is  consensus  against  the  usefulness  of  the 

intervention
The  guidelines  use  a  convention  for  rating  the  level  of  evidence 

(LOE) on which recommendations have been based, as follows:
Level ADerived from data from multiple randomized clinical trials
Level BDerived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized 

studies

Level  CBased  on  the  consensus  opinion  of  experts  or  standard  

of care

DEFINITIONANDDIAGNOSIS

STEMI  is  defined  by  symptoms  of  myocardial  ischemia  associated 
with  persistent  electocardiographic  evidence  of  ST  elevation  and 
subsequent  elevation  of  biologic  markers  of  myocardial  necrosis. 
According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), 
ST elevation in the absence of either left bundle branch block (LBBB) 
or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is defined as new ST elevation of 
at least 2 mm in men or 1.5 mm in women in at least two contiguous 
leads.2 New or presumably new LBBB at initial evaluation should not 
be considered diagnostic of MI. Interpretation of the electrocardio-
gram (ECG) may be obscured by previous LBBB, paced rhythm, LV 
hypertrophy, or Brugada syndrome.

ONSETOFMYOCARDIALINFARCTION

Time until treatment is paramount in the management of STEMI, and 
early recognition, transport, and treatment can improve outcomes in 
patients with this syndrome.

Patient-RelatedDelays
andInitialTreatment
Time delays in seeking care tend to be longer in women, blacks, and 
older  adults.  Reasons  for  delays  may  include  failure  to  recognize 
symptoms,  uncertainty  of  the  severity  of  symptoms,  and  lack  of 
understanding  of  the  importance  of  rapid  treatment.  The  STEMI 
guidelines  emphasize  the  importance  of  health  care  providers 
making anticipatory plans, including the need to activate the emer-
gency medical service (EMS) system and institution of early aspirin 
use. Patients should learn warning systems, develop a survival plan, 
and discuss risk reduction with their physicians to improve potential 
outcomes.

ModeofTransporttotheHospital
Patients with ischemic symptoms should be transported to the hos-
pital by ambulance rather than by friends or family. Ambulance trans-
port is associated with earlier recognition of STEMI, faster times to 

reperfusion,  and  lower  mortality.  The  benefits  of  ambulance  trans-
port are increased by prehospital communication of the diagnosis of 
STEMI and by preference for transfer to hospitals capable of perform-
ing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

CommunityPreparednessandSystems
GoalsforReperfusionTherapy
Time until appropriate reperfusion therapy is one key to the treatment 
of STEMI. Goals of achieving rapid reperfusion should be facilitated 
by community-based systems designed for the rapid management of 
patients with STEMI. Figure 52G-1 outlines the major strategies and 
decision points for the management of patients with STEMI.

Class I recommendations include the following:

  Communities should create and maintain regional systems of STEMI 
care that includes assessment and quality improvement of EMS and 
hospital-based activities (Level of evidence: B).

  A 12-lead ECG should be performed by EMS personnel at the site of 
first medical contact (FMC) in patients with symptoms consistent 
with STEMI (Level of evidence: B).

  Reperfusion therapy should be administered to all eligible patients 
with STEMI in whom the onset of symptoms began within the previ-
ous 12 hours (Level of evidence: A).

  Primary  PCI 

the  recommended  method  of  reperfusion 
when experienced operators can perform it within timely fashion 
(Level of evidence: A).

is 

  EMS transport directly to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is 
the  recommended  triage  strategy  for  patients  with  STEMI,  with  
an  ideal  FMC-to-device  time  goal  of  90  minutes  or  less  (Level  of 
evidence: B).

  Immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is the 
recommended  triage  strategy  for  patients  with  STEMI  who  initially 
arrive at or are transported to a nonPCI-capable hospital, with an 
FMC-to-device time goal of 12 minutes or less (Level of evidence: B).
  Without contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be adminis-
tered to patients with STEMI at nonPCI-capable hospitals when the 
anticipated FMC-to-device time at a PCI-capable hospital exceeds 
120 minutes because of unavoidable delays (Level of evidence: B).
  When  fibrinolytic  therapy  is  indicated  or  chosen  as  the  primary 
reperfusion strategy, it should be administered within 30 minutes of 
hospital arrival (Level of evidence: B).
When  selecting  reperfusion  therapy,  the  provider  must  consider 
several features in relation to these recommendations, including time 
from  the  onset  of  symptoms,  risk  for  STEMI-related  complications, 
risk for bleeding, presence of heart failure or shock, and time required 
for  the  administration  of  fibrinolytics  versus  the  time  needed  for 
transfer to a PCI-capable hospital. Patients best suited for transfer to 
PCI-capable  hospitals  include  those  with  congestive  heart  failure 
(CHF)  or  shock,  high  bleeding  risk,  longer  than  3  to  4  hours  after 
onset of symptoms, and short transfer times to PCI-capable hospitals. 
Those best suited for initial fibrinolytic therapy include patients with 
low bleeding risk, very early after the onset of symptoms, and longer 
delays until the performance of PCI.

RelationshipBetweenSudden
CardiacDeathandST-Elevation
MyocardialInfarction
STEMI  is  inexorably  linked  to  sudden  cardiac  death.  Indeed,  some 
70% of deaths attributable to coronary heart disease occur with out-
of-hospital  arrest.  Comprehensive  management  of  out-of-hospital 
arrest extends beyond the scope of this chapter, but the STEMI guide-
lines offer key recommendations for the evaluation and management 
of patients with STEMI and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including 
the following class I recommendations:
  Therapeutic  hypothermia  should  be  started  as  soon  as  possible  in 
comatose  patients  with  STEMI  and  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest 
caused by ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, 
including patients who undergo primary PCI (Level of evidence: B).

dations is encapsulated in Table 52G-1.

REPERFUSIONATAHOSPITALCAPABLE
OFPERFORMINGPERCUTANEOUS
CORONARYINTERVENTIONS

The  2013  STEMI  guidelines  are  divided  into  sections  describing 
appropriate  care  at  PCI-capable  hospitals  versus  nonPCI-capable 
hospitals.1

PrimaryPercutaneous
CoronaryIntervention
Primary PCI is generally preferable to fibrinolytic therapy when time 
until treatment is short and the patient arrives at a high-volume, well-
equipped center with experienced operators and support staff. When 
compared with fibrinolysis, primary PCI produces higher rates of TIMI 
(Thrombolysis  in  Myocardial  Infarction)  grade  3  flow  and  patent 
infarct-related arteries and lower rates of recurrent ischemia, urgent 
revascularization,  recurrent  MI,  and  death.  Primary  PCI,  when  suc-
cessful, also results in early hospital discharge and return to activi-
ties. Such improvements are less or absent in low-volume centers or 

ProceduralConsiderations
The  2013  STEMI  guidelines  offer  a  class  IIa  recommendation  for 
manual  aspiration  thrombectomy  in  patients  undergoing  primary 
PCI, although subsequent trial data do not show that this procedure 
reduces 30-day mortality in patients with STEMI.3 Class I indications 
are  given  for  the  use  of  intracoronary  stents  at  the  time  of  primary 
PCI (Level of evidence: A). Either drug-eluting stents (DESs) or bare 
metal stents (BMSs) can be used, but when patients are anticipated 
to be at high bleeding risk or are probably not compliant with dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for other reasons, a class I indication is 
given for the use of BMSs and a class III indication for DESsbecause 
of the risk for delayed stent thrombosis in DESs with premature dis-
continuation of DAPT. Table 52G-2 summarizes the adjunctive anti-
thrombotic  therapy  for  primary  PCI,  including  antiplatelet  therapy 
and anticoagulant therapy.

For antiplatelet therapy, class I recommendations include aspirin 

and P2Y12 receptor antagonists.

Aspirin
  Aspirin  (162  to  325 mg)  should  be  given  before  primary  PCI 

(Level of evidence: B).

  After  PCI,  aspirin  should  be  continued  indefinitely  (Level  of  evi-
dence: B). Note: An 81-mg dose of aspirin is recommended for main-
tenance (class IIa; Level of evidence: B) instead of higher doses.

P2Y12 Antagonists
  A loading dose of a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor should be given as early 
as  possible  or  at  the  time  of  primary  PCI  in  patients  with  STEMI 
(Level of evidence: B), with options including clopidogrel, 600 mg 
(Level of evidence: B); prasugrel, 60 mg (Level of evidence: B); or 
ticagrelor, 180 mg (Level of evidence: B).

  A P2Y12 antagonist should be prescribed for 1 year to patients with 
STEMI after primary PCI when they receive a stent. Options include 
clopidogrel,  75 mg  daily  (Level  of  evidence:  B);  prasugrel,  10 mg 
daily (Level of evidence: B); or ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily (Level 
of evidence: B). Note: Prasugrel should not be used (class III, Level 
of  evidence:  B)  in  patients  with  a  history  of  transient  ischemic 
attack (TIA) or stroke.

  For anticoagulant therapy, key recommendations include support-
ive anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH), with dosing 
being  based  on  the  activated  clotting  time  (class  I,  Level  of  evi-
dence: C), or with bivalirudin in patients who have not been treated 
previously with UFH (class I; Level of evidence: B). In patients with 
a  high  risk  for  bleeding,  bivalirudin  is  generally  recommended 
instead of heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist 
(class  IIa;  Level  of  evidence:  B),  and  fondaparinux  should  not  be 
used as the sole anticoagulant (class III; Level of evidence: B).

American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force 
on Practice Guidelines. Circulation 127:e362, 2013.

The 2013 STEMI guidelines recommend fibrin-specific agents over 
nonfibrin-specific agents when available.1 Fibrin-specific regimens 
include single-bolus tenecteplase (TNK tissue plasminogen activator 
[t-PA]), double-bolus reteplase (r-PA), or infusion of alteplase (t-PA). 
Streptokinase administered over a 30- to 60-minute period is the only 
nonspecific  agent  recommended.  The  choice  of  fibrinolytic  agent 
depends on a risk-benefit analysis that integrates time from the onset 
of symptoms, clinical features, comorbid conditions, delay until per-
formance  of  PCI,  and  potential  contraindications  (Table  52G-4). 
Table 52G-5 summarizes antithrombotic therapy for STEMI treated 
with fibrinolytic therapy.

AntiplateletTherapy
  A loading dose of aspirin (162 to 325 mg) and clopidogrel (300 mg 
in  patients  75  years  of  age;  75 mg  in  patients  >75  years  of  age) 
should be administered with fibrinolytic therapy (class I; Level of 
evidence: A).

  Aspirin should be continued indefinitely, and clopidogrel should be 
continued  for  at  least  14  days  and  up  to  1  year  (class  I;  Level  of 
evidence: A). Note: A dose of 81 mg of aspirin is preferred instead 
of higher maintenance dosing (class IIa; Level of evidence: B).

AnticoagulantTherapy
Patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy for reperfusion 
should receive anticoagulant therapy for a minimum of 48 hours and 
preferably  for  the  duration  of  hospitalization,  up  to  8  days  or  until 
revascularization is performed (class I, Level of evidence: A). Accept-
able regimens include UFH for up to 48 hours (Level of evidence: C), 
enoxaparin for up to 8 days (Level of evidence: A), or fondaparinux 
for up to 8 days (Level of evidence: B).
AssessmentofReperfusion
afterFibrinolysis
Sudden and complete relief of chest pain, coupled with greater than 
70% ST resolution, is highly correlated with normal coronary artery 
blood flow in the infarct-related artery and suggests reperfusion.

Key recommendations for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for angi-
ography are summarized in Table 52G-6. The only class I indication 
for  immediate  transfer  in  the  2013  STEMI  guidelines  is  for  patients 
with severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock, but the general recom-
mendation is for all patients who have failed reperfusion or suffered 
reocclusion (class IIa; Level of evidence: B) to be transferred urgently 
and for stable patients to be transferred routinely (class IIa; Level of 
evidence: B).

Key recommendations for indications for coronary angiography and 
PCI are summarized in Table 52G-7. PCI should be performed when 
angiography identifies significant stenosis in the infarct-related arter-
ies. Class I indications relate to high-risk clinical features (cardiogenic 
shock, severe CHF), recurrent spontaneous or provoked ischemia, or 
high-risk features on noninvasive testing. PCI on noninfarct-related 
arteries should be based on spontaneous symptoms (class I; Level of 
evidence:  C)  or  high-risk  features  on  noninvasive  testing  (class  IIa; 
Level  of  evidence:  B)  suggestive  of  ischemia  in  the  territory  of  the 
non-infarctrelated artery. One study published after the guidelines 
suggested a benefit of PCI on noninfarct-related arteries.4

PercutaneousCoronaryIntervention
Adjunctive antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant therapy to support 
delayed PCI are summarized in Table 52G-8. Antiplatelet and anti-
coagulant therapies in patients in whom PCI is delayed are similar to 
those in patients who undergo PCI early, but the timing and dosing 
of  P2Y12  antagonists  differ  depending  on  the  time  interval  and 
type  of  fibrinolytic  agent  given.  Notably,  a  loading  dose  of  300 mg  
of  clopidogrel  should  be  administered  (if  not  already  given  with 
fibrinolysis)  within  24  hours  of  PCI  and  a  600-mg  loading  dose

evidence: B); and patients at the time of operative repair of mechanical 
defects, such as a ventricular septal defect (Level of evidence: B).

In general, aspirin should be continued throughout the pre-CABG 
and peri-CABG periods. With the understanding that CABG is often 
urgent  in  the  setting  of  STEMI,  clopidogrel  or  ticagrelor  should  be 
discontinued for at least 24 hours when possible. In stable settings, 
clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be stopped for 5 days and prasugrel 
stopped for 7 days before CABG, but earlier surgery may be consid-
ered if the benefits outweigh the risks (class IIb).

The  2013  STEMI  guidelines  accord  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting 
(CABG)  a  relatively  limited  role  in  the  management  of  patients  with 
STEMI. The only class I indications for CABG in patients with STEMI 
include  the  management  of  those  whose  coronary  anatomy  is  not 
amenable  to  PCI;  those  who  have  ongoing  or  recurrent  ischemia, 
shock,  severe  heart  failure,  or  other  high-risk  features  (Level  of

RISKASSESSMENTAFTERST-ELEVATION
MYOCARDIALINFARCTION

Post-STEMI  risk  assessment  allows  the  clinicians  initial  impression  
to  be  updated  based  on  data  occurring  during  the  hospital  stay,  
such  as  successful  reperfusion,  angiographic  parameters,  clinical 
heart  failure  or  arrhythmia,  and  ventricular  function;  noninvasive 
testing may be helpful. Testing for the presence of residual ischemia 
may be helpful in patients following STEMI. The only class I recom-
mendation is to use noninvasive testing for ischemia before discharge 
in patients who did not undergo angiography and who did not have 
high-risk  features  for  which  coronary  angiography  would  be  war-
ranted. (Level of evidence: B.)

Because  LV  function  strongly  predicts  outcome  in  patients  with 
STEMI, it is recommended with a class I indication that all patients 
with  STEMI  undergo  measurement  of  their  LV  ejection  fraction 
(LVEF). Echocardiography is the most commonly used modality and 
can assess for mechanical complications, in addition to ventricular 
function. In general, this assessment can be performed on day 2 to 3 
following MI, and in patients with significant ventricular dysfunction 
it  should  be  repeated  more  than  40  days  after  MI  to  evaluate  the 
potential need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

In  the  absence  of  a  reversible  cause,  late  (defined  as  >48  hours 
after MI) in-hospital sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular 
fibrillation  is  an  indication  (class  I;  level  of  evidence:  B)  for  ICD 
therapy. In patients who do not have an indication for ICD therapy 
based  on  late  life-threatening  arrhythmias,  evaluation  of  LVEF  to 
determine  the  need  for  an  ICD  for  primary  prevention  of  sudden 
cardiac death should be performed with sufficient time to allow any 
LV stunning to resolve. Based on the 2013 STEMI guidelines, patients 
with an LVEF of 0.40 or lower should have echocardiography repeated 
more than 40 days after MI. If the LVEF remains 0.35 or lower and the 
patient has a class II or III New York Heart Association classification 
of CHF or an LVEF of 0.30 or lower independent of symptoms, an ICD 
is indicated.

POSTHOSPITALIZATIONPLANOFCARE

Transition  from  hospital  to  outpatient  care  requires  a  careful  dis-
charge and follow-up plan. Class I indications for posthospital care 
planning include the following:
  Posthospital systems of care designed to prevent hospital readmis-
sion should be used to facilitate the transition to effective, coordi-
nated  outpatient  care  for  all  patients  with  STEMI.  (Level  of  
evidence: B.)

  Exercise-based  cardiac  rehabilitation/secondary  prevention  pro-
grams  are  recommended  for  patients  with  STEMI.  (Level  of  evi-
dence: B.)

  A clear, detailed, evidence-based plan of care that promotes adher-
ence  to  medication,  timely  follow-up  with  the  health  care  team, 
appropriate  dietary  and  physical  activities,  and  compliance  with 
interventions  for  secondary  prevention  should  be  provided  to 
patients with STEMI. (Level of evidence: C.)

  Encouragement  and  advice  to  stop  smoking  and  to  avoid 
secondhand  smoke  should  be  provided  to  patients  with  STEMI. 
(Level of evidence: A.)
Key components in the plan of care should include medications, 
physical activity/rehabilitation, risk factor modification, lifestyle inter-
ventions, attention to management of comorbid conditions and psy-
chosocial factors, provider follow-up, patient and family education, 
and socioeconomic factors.
